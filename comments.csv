Do not despair.. there is a solution!<br /><br />My experience:<br /><br />I purchased a B145 from the local Staples for $129.99!!  I unwrapped my new beauty and filled it full of water per the instructions.  My heart sank as the just out of the box unit would not prime.  I figured I must be doing something wrong and called Keurig.  They confirmed the unit was defective... right out of the box!!  Not happy, but I thought I would give it one more go.  I took it back to Staples, who happily exchanged the item.  This time success. The unit works great and I have had no other issues in the month of ownership.  Use of filtered or bottled water highly recommended to extend the unit service life.  Unit has a 1 year warranty from Keurig so I am very happy with my purchase so far.<br /><br />Those who complained about the noise surprised me a bit.  It does hum and buzz a bit I admit... but it lasts what.. maybe 40 seconds while it fills with water.  Really? .. seemed a bit silly to me.<br /><br />Now, the big win here... I was willing to trade the inability to use the ""My K-cup"" for a reliable unit, but found the eKobrew reusable filter for Keurig here on Amazon. It works great with the B145 and I recommend it if you want to use your own blend of coffee.<br /><br />For what it is worth... that's my 2 cents."

We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the ""customer service representative"" if you can call her that, simply said ""if you don't like it then don't buy it."" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any ""stickers"" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it."

That's only 174 calories. This is definitely recommended for anyone who loves chocolate and wants to be healthy too.<br /><br />The brownies are very easy to make. You add in 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of butter and a teaspoon of water. That's it. Bake for just under an hour, then chill for an hour in the fridge.<br /><br />What's neat about the brownies is you have options as to how they come out. Depending on how long you bake them, you can get them to be more cake like or fudge like. We like them about half and half.<br /><br />The chocolate chips seem to ""sink"" into the mix, which gives it the fudgy aspect on the bottom layer. It's a really nice texture, with a crispy top. Even several days later, the ones that are left (assuming you eat them at a reasonable pace) are still quite tasty.<br /><br />Now I do want to comment that you SHOULD eat them only one at a time. My boyfriend was a bit greedy when we first made these, and ate a bunch. These are LOADED with sugar alcohols.  There are 15g of sugar alcohols per serving. This gives it a fantastic sweet flavor - but they cause digestive problems if eaten in large quantities. One brownie is fine. Six brownies .... less fine. Be wise. Eat just one.<br /><br />Some people ask me why they don't just use Splenda instead of sugar alcohols. Splenda doesn't bake as well as sugar alcohols do - the flavor comes out differently. I really do believe this is the best formulation for its fantastic flavor, but again, be aware of the content. Eat in moderation.<br /><br />I really love these. You get a rich brownie flavor for hardly any calories and almost zero carbs. It really is quite ideal for anybody who loves chocolate - on any eating plan - who wants to avoid sugar.<br /><br />The nutrition values are: 174 calories, 12g fat (no trans fats), 55mg sodium, 3g fiber, 15g sugar alcohols, 1.5g net carbs. You get tiny amounts of some vitamins, nothing to really consider important.<br /><br />I would even recommend parents make these for their kids, if their kids demand chocolate, rather than giving them sugary versions."

The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.<br />Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee."

So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself.

If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim."

We always called it ""rooster sauce""...and my first exposure to it was this little bar/restaurant that was local to the college I was attending at the time (quite some time ago...lol).  Anyway, I used to put this sauce on EVERYTHING - pizza, burgers, french fries, marinara-based pastas....even omelettes/scrambled eggs.  But once I graduated and moved, I didn't run across Sriracha chili sauce (the original Huy Fong version, that is) for years.  I stumbled across it recently on an Asian food website and promptly ordered 4 bottles.  I just ordered 6 more today!  And just so you know, the Amazon price for the 6-pack beats anything I've come across thus far (especially considering that it's eligible for free shipping if you spend $25 or more).<br /><br />While I love anything spicy, I suppose that some folks might find this to be a bit much (so if you don't like spicy food, stear clear).  But for those of you who enjoy ""spicy"", this is the ultimate condiment!  I disagree with the reviewer who stated that they don't taste much of a difference between this and Tabasco.  This sauce tastes like chili peppers and garlic.  I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar taste to it.  Plus, Sriracha sauce is THICK - which I like much better, as it stays on food like pizza or french fries.  Tabasco is watery...and isn't as hot as Sriracha.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great deal - so stock up!  You won't be disappointed!"

I bought these, Navitas and a generic brand, from Peru at my local food store to compare. Compared to the other 2 these were of terrible quality, both in appearance and taste. They look washed out, and don't have the fresh, sort of oily look that the other raw organic cacao nibs I bought had and are much smaller pieces. They are about half the six of others on average and the bag included much of what I would call cacao nib powder. Their taste is less pungent and their texture a bit dry, less cool and crispy than others. The biggest problem with them is that the bag is FULL of shells, which are not chewable, and must be picked out. You cannot eat them in crunchy delicious handfuls at your desk.... or even pour them into a recipe. Actually, you have to meticulously inspect each small group of them for shells, which are hard to tell from these super small nibs. Anyway, for the best quality I would go with Navitas or another brand that you can see in person before you buy. From my experience if they look good they are good! I hope this helps."

I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course)."

It is conspicuously absent from the shelves of many big box pet food stores.  maybe some mom-and-pop's carry this brand.  I have some finicky eaters who have their days when they decide they don't want to eat the homemade Food.  It is likely due to years of eating popular brand foods with high carb content,  mostly corn.  no doubt it can taste yummy but it's the same prescription for fattening livestock before the slaughter.  not exactly the goals I have for my cats.  they are made to have a high protein diet.  when was the last time you saw a wildcat chewing down on some corn?  by going to high  protein  I have noticed  am marked increase in my cats activity level.  also  their litter boxes smell much better.  high-protein wet food is the best day to day choice for my pets.

I really love buckwheat and use it in a variety of different ways including as a hot morning cereal, fresh ground for homemade bread and  pancakes (nothing beats fresh ground buckwheat flour made into pancakes with 100 wholesome maple syrup) and even in a type of pilaf. After re-reading a few things it appears there are some misconceptions about this product...<br /><br />1. - This is indeed raw and whole grain groats. If you are searching for roasted/toasted buckwheat you need to keep searching. If you are searching for partially ground, flaked, rolled, etc you also need to keep looking. For those that are familiar with Kasha - this is not roasted nor partially broken...when cooked it will turn into little round balls rather like tapioca.<br /><br />2. Not mushy...try this a few times to get the cooking correct. I eat this for breakfast with a little honey several times  per week and it is excellent. No gluten, lots of nutrition including most essential amino acids, very little fat/calories...it's nearly the perfect food. Bring the water to a boil, put in the groats, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for a few minutes. Keep an eye on it - the buckwheat will ""puff"" and become soft. After a few attempts you will learn to recognize the preferred consistency that suites you best.<br /><br />3. Superb nutrition & versatile. Buckwheat should be considered a super-food it's so nutritious without all the other garbage. It's also incredibly versatile - from a hot breakfast cereal (boil and use a touch of honey) to fresh ground for bread (bread makers, use about 1:4 ratio with fresh ground whole wheat...since this has no gluten the wheat will allow it to rise while the buckwheat adds essential nutrients the wheat lacks. For those with a gluten intolerance, buckwheat is a superb alternative and can be used to create bread without any gluten but you will need to use an enhancer to help it rise."

I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. The chocolate flavor of this drink is terrific- sweet and chocolaty, totally delicious, and I drank this every day for decades.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

Some water isn't safe to drink and so it's good that we can get bottled water at times, but it somehow became a status symbol and then a necessity. Now people are either realizing maybe it's dumb to buy bottled water when the bottled water industry isn't even as well regulated as tap water, or moving on to other beverages as ""plain"" water is starting to seem a little boring, so what do the people who sell water do to sell more product? They make it fancier, with caffeine or gathered in glacial melt and harvested from the deep sea, or, it seems, with a high pH.<br /><br />There are all kinds of health claims made about high pH water, but as far as I know there aren't any reputable, scientific studies that back up any of the claims. If there were, I'm sure Essentia would be shouting those claims from the rooftops to sell their product.<br /><br />If you really believe you need water with a pH of 9.5, maybe research what the tap water in your area already is, and if it's not high enough for you there are many options for water ionizers you can purchase in all price ranges."

It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Amazon's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Amazon prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!<br />Amazon shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were  not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Amazon- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that amazon offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered.

I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.

89427,89428,B0014WYXQK,A2HXE29CU1I24Y,"R. Ocampo ""Artisan""",2,3,3,1209081600,Original owners had a great cause and purpose.,"INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" would be ""pure juice made from Apple""...which goes on to list in this order ""White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate.""  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider."

They are mostly made of apple, very soft, chewy, and just about melt in your mouth.<br /><br />If Amazon becomes more reasonable on their bulk packaging... I'll be picking them up here, otherwise I'll buy them individually.<br /><br />They do come in a resealable ziploc package but not enough in a 1 oz to really ""keep"" for long so I feel it's a wasted benefit.

Instead, I pack a tall glass (not plastic) to the brim with ice, spoon in the desired amount of sugar or sweetener (I use Splenda Blend) and then pour the hot tea over the ice.

Anderson,4,4,5,1314403200,Ka&ntilde;iwa is Similar but Different from Quinoa,"Quinoa is, in my opinion, rather a miracle food, that has resolved many of my long-standing health problems. But this is not about Quinoa, but rather Ka&ntilde;iwa. Some refer to Ka&ntilde;iwa as ""baby quinoa"", which is an easy way to understand it. It is very similar to quinoa in the ways it is handled, processed and cooked. It is not just small quinoa, though, but a distinct breed. Ka&ntilde;iwa = Chenopodium pallidicaule while Quinoa = Chenopodium quinoa. You see? Different.<br /><br />There are important differences in processing and use. For processing, Quinoa when harvested is covered with a bitter unpleasant tasting compound (saponins). These make it easier to grow since it is pest-resistent, but requires special processing to remove the saponins. Ka&ntilde;iwa does not have this issue, which means you don't need to check how the grain was processed prior to purchase. For use, the ka&ntilde;iwa is more finely-grained than quinoa. Quinoa is larger and after cooking similar in size to uncooked rice. Ka&ntilde;iwa is smaller, which gives it a smoother texture. The question is really what texture you prefer. Nutritionally, they seem to be similar, although we haven't studied these very long and need more nutritional research. Specifically taking advantage of the fine texture of ka&ntilde;iwa, I like to use it in custards, breakfast dishes, desserts, cream pies, and similar foods, since it works well in creamy textured foods while adding protein and fiber and making the dishes more nutritious. I tend to use quinoa more in salads, pilafs, tabbouleh, and similarly textured dishes."

(and also other flavors),"I have been on a long quest for ""nutrition bars"" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: ""dates, almonds, and cherries"". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk."

Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my ""real"" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%.

Because I just can't give up that fizziness, or the caffeine, or something.  And while these Sparkling Ice drinks may not have caffeine, they definitely have the fizz that I so enjoy in my drinks.  And the flavors aren't half bad either.  In fact, this Pink Grapefruit one is one of the better ones.<br /><br />I don't like grapefruit.  So why did I buy a flavored drink with that then?  Well there's something about this grapefruit taste that I like.  It's not too sour, but not too sweet either.  And considering I avoid the real fruit I can't say whether or not that it tastes like the real thing, I would think it's probably pretty close.  But it's just good, easy to drink, and definitely refreshing.  And there isn't an overabundance of flavors to get crazy with.<br /><br />The ingredients; they actually aren't too bad.  The list isn't very long, and the flavorings are natural.  There's actual grapefruit in this bottle.  There's even green tea extract.  The problems come in the form of color.  There is a type of red dye in this drink.  And I'm not too impressed with that.  I'd rather they have made it a healthier drink and it be some other color or clear.  Honestly, I think I'd even pay more if they made it that way.  But this low list of ingredients has some other positives that come with it too.  There are 0 calories and 0 sugars in this drink.  Which is incredible.  And there's even some B vitamins thrown in too.<br /><br />So while the dye makes it a tad less than healthy, this is still a pretty good soda substitute.  It's healthy, still has the fizz, and tastes good.  I definitely will keep buying it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"

Also, ""Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors."" EDEN Organic Millet is low fat, contains no saturated fat or cholesterol, a good source of fiber, protein, thiamin B1, and magnesium, and an excellent source of manganese. It is also a complete protein source containing all essential amino acids. Gluten Free. 100% whole grain.<br /><br />Millet is extremely versatile whole grain. Determined by the amount of water used in cooking, it can be light and fluffy or soft and creamy. EDEN Organic Millet is delicious plain, with fresh or dried fruit, or with sweet vegetables such as winter squash and sweet corn. Serve it as porridge and as a main grain for lunch or dinner. Millet tastes great with just about any condiment such as EDEN Organic Gomasio, EDEN Shake, and EDEN Dulse Flakes, or with roasted seeds or nuts. For best results and to impart a nuttier flavor and fluffier texture, dry roast the washed millet in a cast iron or heavy skillet, over a medium-low flame, stirring constantly until golden, and then cook according to package directions. It is deliciously creamy and soothing in soups and stews, and can be used to make grain burgers, croquettes, salads, and in desserts, whole grain muffins, breads, pancakes and waffles. It makes awesome millet mashed potatoes; just cook millet with cauliflower and mash. You can even use it to make stuffing for squash and cabbage rolls.<br /><br />Millet tastes great sweet or savory.  Add some cinnamon and maple syrup for breakfast.  OR throw some into whatever sweet or savory soup you are creating.  Throw some in your coffee grinder to make fresh millet flour.  Since millet's natural flavor is so mild, you can do with it just about anything and it just tastes great adding nutrition and giving you a great source of silica."

After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae."

They are very different from regular brown lentils, with a lighter, less earthy flavor.  Red lentils do not require any soaking, just rinse.  High in fiber, they are superb in soups and appealing to children as well as adults.  I highly recommend an easy Moroccan type red lentil soup with lots of fresh lemon.  Google for recipes.  Or  Simply chop one onion and saute quickly in olive oil,  add plenty of chicken or vegetable broth, a can of diced tomatoes (or chopped fresh), perhaps some chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and juice from several lemons (I make the entire lentil bag at once because the soup goes fast in my house).  The soup cooks on the stovetop in only an hour or so.  Warm and tasty in winter, light and citrusy  enough for summer.  Red lentils freeze well.  Fabulous healthy vegetarian meal served with whole grain crusty bread.  Comfort food at its best.  Try them!"

My lactation consultant recommended this tea to me and I ordered it right away. Earlier this week, I was pumping at best half of what I had previously pumped and we had started tapping into my freezer stash, which was scary to me. By Wednesday the tea had arrived and I immediately started drinking it. Thursday was my lowest day ever, I was able to pump only 6 oz total all day long and I was so discouraged. This morning I woke up with my breasts feeling very full like they had before my supply began to reduce and I just completed my first pumping session and was able to pump about a half ounce MORE than I typically pump! I drank the tea 3 times on Wednesday and 5 times on Thursday. Once I feel like my supply has completely regenerated, I will probably reduce the tea to 2 or 3 times a day, but this tea is amazing!

I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. (""edible"" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it ""gourmet"" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies ""chunky"" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself ""gourmet"" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a ""real"" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again.

She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a ""chicken flavor"".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog.

After reading many reviews on different cat foods, I tried Blue Buffalo.  He did stop throwing up but he did not like it.  We tried the Taste of the Wild and he loves it.  It may be pricier but he eats less and doesn't throw it up.  I can't tell you how many rolls of paper towels and Resolve carpet cleaner we used to go through with the Purina food.  I think this food will actually save us money in the end."

How wrong I was!  I was surprised to see its price jumped up to $ 22.15 when I wrote this review (cheaper when buy it via subscribe and save) which comes to about $ 3.69 a box, still cheaper than its price of $ 3.99 (plus sales tax) in my local Target.  However, the problem was when I opened its BIG box up, there were only five tiny packages: a small pack of hummus dip, a small pack of multi-seed crackers, a small pack (0.75 oz) of fruit and nut mix, a small pack of Dry Roasted Edamame and a very tiny (0.43 oz) roast dark 60% cacao organic dark chocolate.  Unless you eat like a bird, there is no way this box can serve as anything but a snack, a very small one.<br /><br />(1) Hummus dip and multi-seed crackers - there is 13 gram of fat (3 gram saturated fat) in the hummus dip, however the biggest problem is its large content of salt (450 gm sodium).  It tasted so salty (bitter) that it completely ruined the taste of the hummus.  If you eat this dip everyday, you would have high blood pressure for sure.  Now the crackers are quite good but there are really only a few of them.<br /><br />(2)Baja Blend fruit nut mix - I was surprised to see it has 5 gm of fat and 9 gm of sugar in such a tiny bag (0.75 oz or 21 gm).  It tastes quite sweet, a little bit tart and wow, spicy HOT! It burned my tongue.  A very strange mix, not too bad but very unusual and I am not sure I want to repeat the experience. I could not figure out where the hot spice comes from even after I read its package repeatedly.<br /><br />(3) Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame - quite healthy, only 150 gm of sodium and 4 gm fat (0.5 gm saturated).  It tasted pretty good but no different than any roasted edamame you can buy yourself.  It would be much cheaper.<br /><br />(4)Chocolate - yes, its is supposed to be organic, but strange enough it will not tell you how much sugar or fat it has.  The chocolate piece's outside is also whitish, to me that may be a sign of the chocolate becomes too old or? How does it taste? It taste like anything but chocolate.  I do not believe I can eat more than a bite of it.<br /><br />Therefore, not trying to bad mouth this product, but why would I want to pay about $ 3.69 to pay for a box of something that is not healthy, not filling, not tasting good unless, well, you want to lose weight.  I believe if you would eat it as your meals everyday, you will be almost guaranteed to lose weight because you would simply discard the whole box before you can finish them and will still feel hungry."

Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with ""human grade"" ingredients.

We have limited counter space, so this was the perfect solution for keeping the K-cups close at hand.  It is well made - there is NO issue that this drawer cannot hold the weight of the machine.  The only thing to consider is the space between your counter and cabinets.  Once the machine is placed on top of the drawer, you may not be able to open the machine the whole way.  In my kitchen, it's just enough to put the K-cups in and out although it will not open the full way.  That's something that you should consider when determining if this product will work for you.  We love it."

I had found their more traditional flavors at my local grocery, but happened upon their fig preserves at a boutique cafe in my area. However, they were charging $6.99 per jar. I love fig preserves, but $7 is a bit steep. I grew up with a French father, and spent lots of time visiting family in Southern France. I remember having my Aunt's homemade fig preserves on fresh baguettes and croissants for breakfast in the morning throughout my life. I developed a taste for preserves made from mirabelle plums, figs, and still love strawberry as well. And, while Smuckers Strawberry Preserves are fine for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it's just not the taste or quality I love for breakfast. Bonne Maman also makes a great strawberry, and Four Fruits preserves as well, but fig is by far the best in my opinion. All their fruit preserves have more pieces of real fruit in them than your standard American brands. I love having an actual strawberry or fig turn up on my english muffin rather than just more flavored corn syrup. When I found the fig preserves, in particular, here on Amazon at a more reasonable price (around $4.25 a jar) I was sold immediately. I will definitely use 6 jars of this within several months time, and certainly before they go bad. The irony of this find was that the day after I finally had ordered and received my first 6 jars I stopped by a grocery I don't frequent. There in the jam and jelly aisle were Bonne Maman Fig Preserves on sale for $1.99/jar. I had no idea. Needless to say, I will be checking there first, but will absolutely be buying these again if a $7 jar is my only other option. These are great preserves, and the only better ones I've found come from my Aunt's kitchen. They're a little harder to come by these days."

There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of ""Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb"" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site ""soap"" dot com.

I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.

I am currently in dental hygiene school and thus have recently learned the benefits of xylitol. The reason this is so good is that it is a natural sweetener that tricks bacteria into thinking it's regular sugar. When bacteria ingest it they have no way to digest it, which results in death of the bacteria and therefore lowers your risk for cavities when used daily.<br /><br />Now for anyone who has TMJ issues (if you don't have TMJ, then you don't have to bother reading this one paragraph) it is recommended that you not chew gum at all. I myself am one of these people. Whenever I chew gum my jaw ends up hurting for days. However, I spoke with the dentist at my college about this issue and he actually recommends to continue chewing xyliotol gum but to only chew for 5 minutes maximum, particularity after sugary snacks only. For myself, this seems to work. If I eat something high in sugar and chew Spry gum for only 5 minutes afterward, it'll help get the xyliotol in my mouth to fight off cavity causing bacteria but won't be long enough to cause me pain in my jaw.<br /><br />Overall, if you're one who gets cavities often, try Spry gum!"

Galloner ""JG""",1,1,4,1256169600,"Finally, caught a mole!","I've had a problem with moles for just a few months, but they have done quite a bit of damage to my yard in that short time.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try the Out of Sight trap.  It took me a few weeks but I finally caught one mole (I'm sure there's more out there).<br /><br />I tried following the directions on the box as well as the directions in the reviews here.  I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.  The traps do require a bit of strength to set and you need to be careful with them as the spring is very strong. At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs. I'm certainly not an expert, but it sounds like moles feed largely on these grubs. So getting rid of the grubs may prevent future moles...that's next on my to do list."

But I don't like some thick rawhide sticks because they became slimy and sometimes I have to dig in my dogs' throats to get leftovers (great choking hazard).<br /><br />I was a bit worried after reading negative reviews, I didn't want my dogs to get sick and me being sick from the vet bills. But I gave my dogs one stick each and they liked it a lot. It took them about 20 minutes to finish. I was watching them and they really enjoyed that thing. I was surprised that rawhide part was actually coming off in small bites, easy to swallow (second dog was rather chewing on it though). One dog finished earlier and was intimidating the other, so he swallowed about 1/4 of the chewed stick and I ended up with finger in his throat, so I guess they will enjoy them under my supervision.<br /><br />I took one star for the price, it comes to more than 50 cents per stick (I see the price is changing, it was as high as one dollar per stick)-kind of expensive. Also I would be more happy with the long lasting snack like that to be more safe (that can be my dogs chewing and swallowing bigger parts). But so far I am happy to see occupied dogs and they have no digestive problems at all with a bit looser poop than unusual, but nothing runny and weird (gotta pick it up on the walks). But as it says, the snack is digestive support, so it is not a daily snack, more of a helper with constipated dog."

Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.

I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us.

I use it for all sorts of meal bases.  You could just eat it plain though.  It's that good.<br /><br />The batch I just went through though was a real trial to get into.  I've ordered this brand before with no troubles but this batch (all dozen) was a real pain to open.  You are supposed to just vent the lid by peeling it back slightly before you microwave it but that was pretty much impossible.  The seal between the top and the bowl was so strong, you just couldn't.  I ended up just cutting the top free.  I've got to tell you, microwave packaging isn't generally much of a challenge for me but this was.  Just beware it's possible that, if you have a physical infirmity, this packaging might be a challenge."

Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.

I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU"">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4"">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's ""Big Easy Bold"").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed."

It's ok and this should be the base standard.<br />- Filtered water (from my refrigerator): I might be biased but the filter does a good at removing chlorine and particulate without removing some minerality, it tastes fresh and clean.<br />- Essentia (aka, the winner): the mouthfeel is smooth and it coats your mouth, it doesn't weight heavy on you, I guess this might be the electrolytes or PH balance.

I liked the ingredient list as well as the nutrient content on this brand. I haven't really heard of the brand before but did a search on it and found some favorable reviews. My dogs really love it and it seems like the amount listed on the package to feed (based on weight) seems to satisfy them.  They are not extremely active so I have to watch their weight. Also there seems to be not a lot of waste (yard clean-up) associated with the food which tells me it doesn't have tons of fillers. Overall I think this is a quality food and a great buy.

I place small triangular wedges of wood in the 4 corners of the pan. Then spread out a thin layer of cat litter. Then I place the sifting pan to rest on the wooden wedges. This keeps the sifter surface above the litter by about 1 inch. The rabbit drops his raisins that fall between the grade making it very easy to take the sifter out and hose it down in the yard. I take the spoiled litter pan with its contents and place those into a plastic bag I get from the super market when I go shopping. I tie the bag up with the spent litter and it goes outside to the waste bin. I hose down the litter sifter and pan every other day. The sifter does a great job of protecting the sensitive feet of rabbits. Rabbits are very clean animals and don't like to be near too soiled litter.

Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little ""graham"" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not ""light and crispy"" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their ""customer promise of satisfaction"", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case."

After having them cleaned by the vet under anesthesia (sp??), the vet recommended we give him this brand of chewies to help keep those expensively-cleaned choppers shiney.<br /><br />I am not sure exactly what is different about these than other brands, but they sure seem to do the trick.  We have had dogs in the past that used cheaper brands of various chewies, and I don't think they actually did much as far as really keeping the teeth clean.  Five years later, this dog's teeth are still nice and tidy and he has not had to have them re-cleaned by the vet.  (And if I remember right, it was almost 300 bucks to have him do it!)<br /><br />Though the dog mentioned could possibly use the smaller chews, we have 2 other dogs (a border terrier mix and a Walker coonhound/retriever mix), and when I get this size, it seems they can all share one bag and do okay.<br /><br />I recommend these if you have a dog with tartar problems specifically, but really, these seem to do a nice job keeping any dogs teeth free of ick!<br /><br />(Side note-- the chihauhau mix that I spoke of used to have seizures now and then-- maybe 5 or 6 a year-- that the vet could not find a cause for.  Since having his teeth cleaned, he has had only 3 seizures in the last 5 years.  I can't say for sure that his dental hygiene played a part in this, but it does seem a strange coincidence!)"

Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea.

Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process.

Denton ""Life Picker""",1,1,2,1342310400,"Too many culls, substandard processing, inconsistant moisture content.","Despite how many regions of the USA can grow pumpkins, the market for roasted in-shell pumpkin seeds is dominated by David (Conagra) due to their distribution abilities.  Although David's seeds are too salty, they are a consistent product with good flavor, dense nut meats and well regulated moisture content.  And yes,did I mention that they are too salty.  So when I came upon the high praise given to these seeds, I bought a 12 pack.  As noted, the price on these is significantly lower than Davids.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed with the product.  The first issue I noticed was the lack of grading.  Fallow seeds (flat seeds with no nut meat) and other irregular seeds are included in quantities which vary from pack to pack, but there are too many.  Additionally the nutmeats are quite inconsistent in density and moisture content.  Some nut meats have little density and just crumble during the shelling process. The shells are quite a bit thinner than the David brand, which causes them to collapse, rather than cleanly splitting, when pressured on the edges.  This transfers a lot of the salty shell into your mouth.  So although these have less salt on them, more salt is ingested in the process of eating them.<br /><br />You might be happy with these if you are looking for a cheaper product than the David brand, but I was looking for a superior product and these are not it."

Factoring this in, I think the cost for a bag of Precise is very close to that of a lower quality cat food.<br /><br />I also worried the cats would not like this food, as they are extremely picky and it had reached a point that Meow Mix is all they wanted.

My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor."

Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.

I wish this had been around when I had my first daughter as I attempted to make her baby food, but gave up after a couple of weeks.  The Baby Brezza has made it possible as a working mom of two young girls to make my little one's meals that are easy to make and don't require constant monitoring.  You just chop up the veggies, select the steam time, press steam & blend, and walk away.  A little while later, the food is ready and there's only a few parts to clean up.  I can make her food 2-3 times a week with different ingredients and blend different veggie/fruit combinations.  I've tested sweet potato, apples, pears, peas, carrots, avocado (just blending), mango, peaches & plums and various different combinations. I envision this will be useful for many months and afterwards steam veggies for the entire family.  It will definitely more than pay for itself with the money saved!  Of course, I could make it with other kitchen equipment, but the Baby Brezza saves so much time and makes the whole process much easier and I'm much more likely to continue to make her food for as long as possible."

I have fewer 'rejects' than with other brands and they cook up quickly nice and tender without turning to mush. I sautee my veggies first: all small dice: a couple of serranos (since we eat spicy--this is optional), a large onion, a couple of carrots, lots of celery, a whole garlic fist, tomatoes (I often just use a can of organic diced tomatoes, sometimes fire-roasted), sometimes leeks (although i put those in later or they will disappear) with whole cumin seed, oregano, turmeric and curry powder (I use the Simply Organic brand which I like the best after much exploration). Seasonings can vary. Coarse grind black pepper. A little trocomare or herbamare depending if I make my own stock, use prepackaged or just water. Sometimes add leftover chicken or lamb. After the veggies are quite sauteed add the liquid and lentils and bring to slow simmer. Do not let them boil hard but they need to slow simmer to cook. Hmmmm. I may need to go make some now. Especially delicious the second and third days. I add fresh parsley just as serving or sometimes serve over fresh spinach to just slightly cook it. Pita or cornbread goes well. My family enjoys different types of cheese as topping.<br /><br />I am on my third order of these and have yet to find a stone.<br /><br />Update: When I really did just go make these I realized that those unused to using bulk products may not know you need to sort through any product like this. I just pour them into a container and then have another container to slowly pour them into as I sort through them. My new shipment are the BEST lentils I have EVER used in about fifty years anywhere. Only had about ten discards (any lentil that I would not want to eat and I am very picky--broken, dirty, etc.)<br /><br />Also, I just read the instructions on the package which do not make clear that you need to sort through and then rinse the lentils before using. Do not salt any bean-type product until the end or they will be tough.<br /><br />I don't use recipes so I realize that my seasoning amounts are unclear. The only thing you need to add right away to the saute is if you use cumin seed. You can always add more of everything else later. If you want it spicier you can also add something like cayenne, even after serving. I forgot to mention that I sautee all my veggies in a bit of coconut oil for health reasons (it is the only stable oil). You do not taste this later and I finish it at the end of cooking with some good olive oil.<br /><br />When I mentioned the fist of garlic: this must be minced. I use a meat cleaver to smash the cloves to peal more easily and then fine dice. Wait ten more minutes to allow the allicin to develop DONT WAIT LONGER. Allicin is the anticarcinogenic property of garlic and must be exposed to oxygen to develop, but it will start to diminish after about fourteen minutes.<br /><br />OK--there is my novel on cooking lentils! Hope this is useful to someone."

We appreciate the conversation and realize there can be quite a variety of opinions on any food item based on the vast majority of palates and individuals' past experiences with foods.<br /><br />As a Downeast Maine company that has been producing Lobster Bisque from a local recipe since 1917, it is believed that the recipe, handed down from previous generations, was the most accurate rendition of this regional soup. This is not to say that it is the only recipe or the most popular in this genre of soup, as bisque originated in France and was handed down through immigrants who settled in the Canadian maritimes and then migrated to coastal Maine.<br /><br />The original recipe included the tomalley, or liver, of the lobster and provided a truly robust seafood flavor and a deep orange tone to the finished product. With concerns over mercury in seafood, the recipe has been modified in recent years and a larger quantity of minced lobster has replaced the tomalley. This along with a bit of paprika gives the soup its distinctively strong color. The recipe does not include any tomato products. As to the cream content, milk is an ingredient to create the true bisque texture, however, we intentionally leave the soup in a semi-condensed state to allow the customer to prepare the product to their liking. By adding a bit more milk or cream and a dash of sherry at the end of gently heating the bisque, true restaurant-quality lobster bisque can be achieved.<br /><br />This is one of our most popular soups and at over 20 annual international trade shows it receives rave reviews. Thought we realize we cannot please every palate, we believe the majority of our lobster bisque connoisseurs provide us the confirmation that we are making a high quality, great-tasting Lobster Bique.<br /><br />Bar Harbor Foods is now on Facebook, so please ""Like"" us if you enjoy our products and we appreciate hearing from all of our customers!<br /><br />~ Bar Harbor Foods"

Going beyond just offering cheese-covered noodles and ground beef, there are hints of ketchup and mustard and onions, among other tantalizing tastes. My Wife, who is not a big fan of Hamburger Helper, stopped after a few bites- The mustard taste was too much for her. My eight year-old Daughter, not a huge fan of meat of any kind, loved it. For my part, I ate my first helping with gusto, but by the time seconds rolled around, the spice mixture was getting to be overpowering and a bit sickening. I scrapped the noodles and ate the rest of the ground beef. It wasn't bad, but the spice mix wasn't something that made me want to keep eating it. I'll happily try other Velveeta Hamburger Helper knock-offs, but this one didn't quite hit the spot the way I'd hoped."

This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.  This caffeine-free herbal blend brews up into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart and tastes like minty cherry syrup.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues.""

I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"

Brewing it is a breeze; it's got a good blend size that permits the Chemex to function very well, and percolate through the coffee quickly.<br /><br />The flavor and taste of coffee is why we drink it.  And here the Starbucks comes through fine.  But beware; this is not overly cloying flavor masking the taste of the coffee; instead, the vanilla flavor adds to the coffee taste, rather than overwhelming it, as you can get in those 'international flavor' instant coffees.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a full-flavored coffee, perhaps even more on the dark-roasted side (at least that was the flavor to me).  I'm more of a fan of the regular roast, so it was a bit heavy for me.

I normally use breadcrumbs and fry pork on the stove, but I liked giving baking a try. The flavor of the pork worked out just fine, but I wasn't crazy about the Shake 'N' Bake seasonings. I prefer my old breadcrumbs.<br /><br />You can just put the seasonings in a Ziploc bag and shake them on as suggested, or just put the seasonings into a dish and coat the pork that way. It's certainly simple enough either way, a healthier alternative to frying, and doesn't require a lot of clean-up. Three people ate this and all gave sort of a mild thumbs-up. I wouldn't eat it again, but I liked it enough to try the chicken flavor next."

The taste lives up to its outstanding reviews in every way, but the fine grind of the loose tea was not what I expected. This is not what I would call loose tea; instead, it is tea dust. It makes for a cloudy, murky brew (looks like a mud puddle). I guess I could use paper filters, but for me the point of loose tea is that I can eliminate the need for the filter. Not only for environmental reasons, but because tea and coffee just taste better when brewed without paper filters. Against all odds, though, the tea still tastes great.

These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.

I like my coffee bold, and strong, so trying to drink normal coffee (especially of the instant variety) is like giving a whiskey junkie a glass of Kahlua and milk.  So with that in mind, take note that my definition of ""weak"" may be very different from yours.  Anyway, let me start with my review.  Taster's Choice is meant to be made in 6oz portions.  I filled my standard sized 12oz (The Who!) coffee mug around 3/4 to the brim, so I may have over filled it a bit. (READ UPDATE BELOW)  That being said, Taster's Choice would only provide you a half-full mug of coffee if you followed their instructions properly.  The coffee tasted similar to what you would find at a cheap gas station.  It can only be described as similar to Crystal Light packets, in that your water doesn't exactly taste like Gatorade, but it surely doesn't taste like water either.  I tried adding a few tablespoons of flavored coffee creamer to see if it improved the taste, and it did in a big way.  The flavor was then similar to what you would receive out of those automated ""cappuccino machines"" that you would find in gas stations and breakrooms. (You know, the ones that tell you to only fill up the cup 3/4 of the way because the machine keeps flowing coffee even after you let go of the button?)  If you have ever tasted the ""cappuccino"" out of those machines, you'd know that it isn't anything like cappuccino, but it doesn't taste horrible.  It's drinkable, and has a sweet kick to it.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm sure that using two packets would improve the flavor of a 3/4 full mug greatly, so I'm probably going to try that next time around and update my review. (READ UPDATE BELOW) I'm sure that some people would find this useful as a ""fast food coffee"".  It's not great, but it's not bad either, and it provides a little jolt for someone who doesn't have the time to brew a whole pot.<br /><br />*UPDATE*:  I have now tried it with two packets in 8 ounces of water, and it is MUCH better.  It now tastes like quite a bold flavorful coffee.  Highly recommend that you use two packets for each cup."

I had one of them and was excited because these are a lot of my favorite nuts in one pouch, which is hard to find. The first thing I did after the celebration was go on Amazon to subscribe to get these regularly. However, I should have looked at the picture more closely before I ordered because when they arrived I was disappointed to find out that the hazel nuts had been ""replaced"" by walnuts. Everything is exactly the same as the ones I had at work. The package looks the same, they both say ""Heart Healthy Mix"" on them, except walnuts have been substituted instead of hazel nuts.

My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that.

They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know ""it's a good fat"").

I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice.

The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in.

I was seeking out an easy way to make chicken curry even though it is really not that hard to do. I tried the Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Butter Chicken Curry and was blown away. It was just the right heat and I followed the directions exactly and added the recommended amount of water. I always like to try it first according to manufacturer's directions and thought the thickness of the sauce was perfect and the salt wasn't overpowering but we may add a little more water next time. I definitely recommend to not forget the fresh cilantro at the end. It really brings everything together for that authentic taste! Everyone loved it including those that weren't accustomed to spicy food. They still tolerated the spiciness just fine even though it does bring on the sweat! My husband snuck in the kitchen the next day and ate all of the leftovers! He also requested this meal for his birthday.

What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."

NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them.

I'm staunchly anti-banana, but this little treat sounded right up my mum's alley, so I had her eat it. This is what she thought. Keep in mind, Mum is already a big Quaker fan, and an even bigger fan of banana nut bread. She had Quaker oats for breakfast this morning actually. As prompted by the directions, she microwaved it for 10 seconds. She liked the packaging, since you could see the product, it had a full ingredient list, and plenty of nutritional information. The bar is 1.48oz (42g).Mum's initial thoughts were that the bar seemed to have decent nutritional value, and would make a convenient lunch time/after work snack. When she took her first bite, she seemed really impressed that it tasted ""like real banana nut bread!"", and said it had a crunchy but chewy texture with lots of almonds. She said the banana and nut flavors were well balanced.  She really liked it, she ate it super fast (she always yells at me about eating too fast ;_;). She saved tiny morsels of it for both our dogs, who agreed it was delicious.Overall, Mum really liked this Quaker bar. She said she'll probably buy a box of them next time she goes to the grocery store (provided she can find a coupon). She thinks full price ($3.30 MSRP for 6 bars) is reasonable, but like me, she kinda loves saving money. Her only complaint about Quaker's Soft Baked Banana Nut Bread Bar is that it contains corn syrup, aside from that, it was a hit. She gave it a 4/5."

I've tried several other brands, some I liked some I didn't, but this was my first opportunity to enjoy a MIO, and it didn't speak well for the brand.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this product would probably be the taste.  It's supposed to be mango peach and honestly it didn't taste like either of those things.  The suggested serving is 1 squeeze per 8oz serving so I tried that at first in my water bottle.  It tasted like extremely watered down indeterminate flavored gatorade.  Not so good.  So the next time I amped it up and did 3-4 squeezes into my water bottle.  This time the flavor was stronger but it still didn't taste a thing like mango or peach and actually I felt like I was drinking that sugar water they place in hummingbird feeders.  The color was about the same too come to think of it.  It was kind of disappointing not only for the taste, but for the fact that I needed to use 3x the amount suggested to actually taste anything.  This means there probably won't be the 24 servings it says it has.  Not that I'll probably finish it.<br /><br />The only thing this had going for it was that the ingredients were somewhat natural.  But then they through a bunch of red and yellow dyes to bring that down.  It also has an attractive bottle that it comes in, easy to tote around.  But that only goes so far.  This product is supposed to flavor water and since it fails in that area I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011"

I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google ""Doctor Cyberman innards"" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are."

What is missed by making this a 1 cup at a time tea is the immensity of the brew when it's allowed to truly form in the pot. It's true that the pungent orange blossoms are strong, but when given enough room to expand the initial sharp taste becomes a subtle aftertaste. And that's how the green tea works into your system with such ease, because you're gradually absorbing the taste of it tempered by the orange. Want proof of this add any other citrus like apple for instance and see how the orange will gladly stay in the background for it. Or for those who make Kombucha try an amazing base for it with this tea. And no tea will complement my organic beer as well. There's been times where I have drank myself dizzy on the green tea just because I was so absorbed in the brewing flavors. But even after taking a break from it the want of it always comes back and that's how I know the tea is true because like the other reviewers not many appeal to me. I've been drinking this tea solid for about 2 years now nearly every day - more than once a day always - letting the pot sit on a warmer on top of the wood stove during cold weather.

It tasted VERY good -- so good, in fact, that it has become my new favourite cereal!  It must be a combination of the<br />sugar, honey, brown sugar syrup, and cinnamon that gives it a totally unique, totally delicious sweetness.<br /><br />This cereal is a ""multi-type"" cereal, in that not all parts of it look the same.  Darker flakes mix with lighter, rice-crispies-like nuggets, and with small clusters seemingly made from the flakes, to create a visually-different cereal that is almost as exciting to see as it is to eat!<br /><br />It also has an ""OU-Dairy"" seal, from the Jewish Orthodox Union, for those to whom things being kosher is important.<br /><br />On the nutritional good side, this cereal boasts 5 grams of fiber, in every 210 caloorie, 3/4 cup serving. It also has more of a percentage of vitamins and minerals, (ranging from 4% to 110%), of any cereal I have ever seen.  On the bad side, it has 14 grams of sugar per seving.  (Don't eat too much of this cereal at once....or your heart will start racing!)<br /><br />Also to be noted, is that wheat products of ANY kind, and ANY variety of rice, corn, and oil, (with which this particular cereal is LOADED), are said to be bad for the eyes.  So -- balance eating this cereal with eating eggs and drinking tea -- both of which are said to be good for your eyes.<br /><br />This cereal is now the ""official"" cereal of The Ironman Triathalon -- so you know it's got to have SOME sort of superiour nutrition.  On the back of the package are portraits of five male sports stars: Hunter Kemper - Triathalon Champion, Kevin Garnett - Basketball Champion, Peyton Manning - Football Champion, Albert Pujols, and Bryon Clay -- Decathalon Champion,  They all look very strong and very sure of themselves -- AND as if they are challenging the viewer to join them......<br /><br />I wondered why there were no other boxes of Wheaties' Fuel Cereal with WOMEN athletes on them, and called up the General Mills phone number on the box to ask.  I mentioned too, that years ago there had been a commercial which had the jingle: ""He's ready for Wheaties / He knows he's a man!"" -- and that because of this jingle, I, a woman, had been afraid to even try Wheaties!  She assured me that she would pass my suggestion -- that there be another box, with women basketball players, ski champions, ballet dancers, ice skaters, and the like, on it -- on to her supervisors.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm glad I got this particular 14-box collection.  It drives down the cost of each box.  I also intend to put some of this cereal into my blender, turn it into crumbs, and use it instead of breadcrumbs in a number of dishes.<br /><br />When eaten in reasonable amounts, this sugary-cereal- with-lots-fiber can, I think, be very good for one.<br />Only -- don't overdo eating it, even though it is quite sweet, and quite delicious!"

461788,461789,B003UDS8FS,APP9GFL07GW21,Jeff70,1,1,1,1337731200,NOT good food,"Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well."

I put them out all over and<br />got the one cockroach that somehow snuck into the house<br />on the very first night that I set the traps out.  I also caught<br />two silverfish.  The trap gets five stars just for the cockroach.<br /><br />The neighborhood I'm in has these huge vw bug cockroaches<br />with dark shells.  I have to be careful to keep doors closed<br />at night so they won't sneak in.  I hate them because they<br />run when you scream or when you're about to smash them<br />with a shoe on the trash can.<br /><br />Anyways, first thing this morning after having the trap set up<br />last night I see this big cockroach was stuck in the trap and<br />still moving.  I panicked because I couldn't smash it with<br />anything since it was 3/4 in the trap and its head was sticking<br />out and I had nothing to smash with handy.  I squirted maybe 1/4<br />cup of dish detergent onto it because I remembered reading<br />somewhere on internet that cockroaches breathe through their<br />skin.  After it got coated in soap I then was afraid the soap<br />would dissolve the sticky stuff in the trap and set the bugger<br />loose, but happily it struggled and died in the trap.<br />I only had to clean soap off that I squirted but that's okay<br />because cockroaches leave scent trails that need to be washed<br />off to prevent other buggers from following the trail.<br />If you don't squirt the cockroach, the trap and surrounding<br />area will be nice and clean and dry.  The sticky stuff inside<br />the traps stays inside.<br /><br />The traps are a bit hard to separate since you are tearing along<br />a perforation in cardboard after removing a divider strip to<br />separate two traps, but once you get the hang of how to do it,<br />it is okay. I was able to easily handle the traps and not get any<br />of the sticky stuff from inside the traps onto my hands.  Its<br />great that there is no toxic poisonous stuff in the traps."

I'm even more skeptical of the quality of bagged teas, since many ""pyramid"" teabags still have tea leaf fannings or even dust in them, just like the old school ""flat"" tea bags.  This tea not only brews up into a hefty serving of BOP, but the taste is fresh and clean, yet complex enough to be considered a decent spring flush Darjeeling.  I was thrilled, because it can be difficult to find a good spring flush that is affordable and organic as well!  And, while I generally prefer loose tea to bagged, I can use this at work when I'm pressed for time and still enjoy what I'm drinking.  It would be great if the bags weren't stuffed into very small (albeit freshness-preserving) packages which, on my clumsier days, is hard to open without feeling like I'm smashing the leaves.  The teabag strings could be a bit longer as well.  But these are very small complaints, and they will not stop me from ordering again.

But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.

I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.

Activity was as expected for all 2 1/2 weeks of the first ferment. It's racked and aging now, but the taste is already very promising- quite like beer, with plenty of apple notes that the yeast does not overwhelm. I would expect that properly aged the result will indeed be pretty English.<br /><br />Batch 2 I hydrated in the actual juice (reserved from the main stock). You aren't supposed to do this but I wanted to keep my volume of liquid down and my taste undiluted. Low and behold, I got bubbles even faster, in only about 12 hours. VERY impressed.<br /><br />If you use this yeast for cider remember that apple juice/soft cider is nutritionally incomplete for beer yeasts; you should feed it with some yeast nutrient (available on Amazon as well) and some sugar (I use Woodstock organic brown).<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I have completed 2 batches of cider using Nottingham. Results were very good; all sulphery notes during ferment disappeared fairly quickly and the yeast did not impart a yeasty taste to the finished brews. One thing I have noticed is that in both cases, getting the yeast to perk back up for bottle carbonation took a pretty long time- it seems like in an alcohol-rich environment Nottingham dies or goes dormant pretty fast, which probably makes it a good candidate for cold crashing.<br /><br />I will definitely use this yeast again for the great taste and consistent results it produces."

I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared.

This tastes lovely on its own or is incredibly creamy and quiet dreamy with a splash of milk and always with sugar.

This one I would have to rate the best because it's raw, organic and has alot of fiber in it.  Here's the deal:  The serving size is 4 tablespoons and you get 14 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein, 1 g sugar, a small percentage of Calcium, Vitamin E and Iron, 48% Magnesium, and 22% Zinc.  So with all that said, I use only 1 tablespoon per smoothie shake (banannna, frozen strawberries, dash of organic vanilla) all in the blender and I can't even taste the hemp.  I do this three times a day and I am in heaven because I am actually drinking something healthy and not so processed like other protein powders.  This hemp also has a full amino acid profile.  You can't go wrong with this.  If you are looking for a protein powder with a very high amount of protein in it, then the isolated (processed) kinds will have more, but in my opinion your body can't handle all that protein at once and plus the processed varieties are not good for you anyway.  Just take it easy and enjoy the best of the best, rather than overload on highly processed protein powders."

You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!"

I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus.

At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.

I was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine (by cuisinart) with out having to use the supplied filter.  Let's face it, the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k-cup and not have to fill the little filter, then clean it afterwards.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  I was looking for this type of item and hoping that I could pre-package my brand of coffee. I was skeptical at first, but thought for the price, I'd give it a try AND the product works GREAT.  I fill up the 50 cups with the filter, lid and store it in an old K-cup box.  The lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k-cups. The only issue is that on my 12 cup setting, there is a little spill over, but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting.  Once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup, it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup, but that's in once in a while.

Food of the Gods,"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI"">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, ""nutrition"" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of ""yummy."").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to ""gourmet it"" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As ""rice"" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with ""noodle heaven""; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As ""oatmeal"" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than ""outside-the-waves"" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (½) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate ""lid""; zap it for another minute or half, then let it ""steep"" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate ""lid"" I can just place it on the table for family style ""digging in.""<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Arrowhead Mills, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelinas have been added to my list of  purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the ""naked"" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of ""health""?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had ""lived"" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O"">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon"

Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand."

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.

Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess.  They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients.  The shelties love them!  I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything.  Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way.  I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training.  Each bag lasts me about a month, I think."

Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water."

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Euthanized animals and their parts, leashes, collars, microchips, etc. can be processed in their food. Since we have discovered this information, our dogs are healthier, happier, and disease free.

These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears.

If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.<br />But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container.

I think, though, that this food is a pretty good example of how to finesse GA numbers. Everything after 'beef' is mostly hard too digest filler material. Soy [except for soy hulls] is a rapidly fermenting fiber which means it doesn't do a very good job of absorbing water while being digested so the doggie may experience a laxative effect and end up with diarrhea. Yuk. My two dogs haven't seemed to have had that problem but I mixed this 4.5lb bag with about 3 pounds of very high quality food (small/regular breed version): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007794PBM"">Blue Buffalo Large Breed Wilderness Chicken Adult Dry Dog Food, 24 lbs.</a><br /><br />It contains 'poultry by-product meat' which means the carcas minus the feathers. So, head, feet, gristle, etc. 'Animal digest' - google it for an eye opening description at wiki and then the other side of the story from Purina. Although Purina gives a pretty nice sounding description and I'm sure that the nutritional information is accurate, they actually confirm what wiki reports by way of ommission if nothing else. Purina can't be ignorant of what detractors say about this ingredient.<br /><br />The big chunks that are red to represent beef are soft. So if you use dry food because you avoid soft food for your dogs you won't care for this even if it is otherwise not a problem for your situation.<br /><br />I recommend looking for something else.

We initially did not crate him (mostly because members of my family have a phobia of cages) and as a result are out four pairs of shoes, two pairs of prescription glasses, a desk, a leather chair, a leather couch, two desk chairs, and portions of our walls and several door jambs. Needless to say, we crate him now, but while that saved our furniture (what was left of it), it didn't solve our dog's need for mental stimulation. We saw this at Petsmart (for about 10$ more than it is listed here) and figured we had nothing to lose. (As a side note, he does now go to daycare 3 days a week, which helps with his energy levels substantially.)<br /><br />Our dog loves it! Where soft, squeaky, or any other kind of toy lasts only a matter of minutes (though he never did like Kongs) almost 7 months in, and the dog has yet to destroy the blue rubber ball. We have gone through at least a dozen packages of the ""everlasting treats"" made by the same company, which last on average about two days each for him. When we're out of those, we find we can put moderately sized training treats or bits of his kibble in the middle area and he has a grand time rolling it around and bouncing it off walls to get them out. In the summer we also like to smear peanut butter on the inside and freeze it for ten or fifteen minutes before giving it to him.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great investment for us. So much so that we ended up purchasing a second one that we fill with alternate flavors of treats or keep in reserve.<br /><br />My only complaints are these: One of the balls is very easy to get the everlasting disks into (consequently, it's also relatively easy for my dog to get them out again), while the other is so stiff it takes a very long time to get a disk into at all. After all that effort, I feel like my hands are completely worn out. (Edit: I hadn't seen a few other users trick of getting the edges of the treat wet to make it easier to slide into the ball. I will have to try that next time around). Also, the ball is expensive upfront, but lasts long enough to be worth it. The treat disks are also expensive, though, so that's something I've had to work into my budget.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great toy for those dogs that need a toy that can stand up to them.

The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system."

As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues.

For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.

I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee."

However, it was also the weakest of the flavors that I tried--that is, it had the least power, and when room temperature, the blackberry hardly came through at all.

Weevils (bugs) are an unavoidable aspect of whole grains. All grains have weevil eggs in them. But when you buy grains, they should be free of mature, live bugs when they arrive, and they should stay that way for a long time. When you buy organic brown rice, do you expect to find bugs in it when you get home? No. With proper storage, it should remain bug-free for the shelf life of the grain. After sifting through several cups, the bug problem forced me to toss this wheat.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the wheat was not very well cleaned. I had to remove a lot of foreign seeds and the occasional small rock."

I bought two boxes for my mother. For $10 a package it was an excellent price. I understand these were returns to Amazon but it didn't look like it. It was in brand new unopened condition. I normally would give 5 stars except for one thing. The ""best by"" date listed July 30, 2012. I got it May 31, 2012. If it was 6 months I probably wouldn't worry but two months is a problem. So I dropped it to 3 stars. The price and the fact I still have two months saves it. I guess I will have to help my mom finish these off. Luckily they are pretty good. I may buy again from the seller since the price is good. Wish the ""best by"" could have been listed before I ordered.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 13, 2012) Bought again through Amazon but from  another seller, ezee llc (lindasproperties), for $17.10 per 24 pack. That was way more than my original order but my mom wanted more. Seeing it was close to the MSRP of $19.99, I was expecting to receive a product that had a better ""best by"" date. No, this time it was worse. The ""best by"" date is August 17, 2012. I have little over a month to go. Granted my mom will probably finish it within that time frame but this is unacceptable. I'm dropping the product rating to two stars due to unsatisfactory experiences with two different sellers. I should get at lest six months.<br /><br />UPDATE (October 24, 2012) I guess my mom goes through this quite quickly. I purchased through a seller on eBay for $17.95 per 24 pack on September 10, 2012. This time around I got a package that was well more than a year out for the ""best by"" date. So I guess I know now that this product actually has a good shelf life if purchased from a proper seller. I realize my star rating is harsh since it focuses on the seller not the product. The taste and flavor is excellent and I have definitely purchased and drank this multiple times when I am at my parents.

84337,84338,B0002IMRQA,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""",0,0,5,1266969600,Uniquely delicious,"It was quite a thrill for me to suddenly find cartons of Big Red sitting on the shelves of a local mega-large retailer a few months ago.  I had never heard of Big Red until one of my college roommates brought some to school with him (and that has been some years ago).  At the time, I found the bubble gum taste interesting, but I didn't get a large enough sample of it to really know whether I liked it or not.  Then, several years later, some Big Red magically appeared in a local convenience store, and that is when I grew to love it.  Alas, the stuff soon disappeared off of this store's refrigerated shelves, leaving me to wonder if I would ever enjoy this unique soda drink again.  This may be a Southern product dating all the way back to 1937, but few folks here in North Carolina have ever heard of the stuff.  Maybe that will begin to change now - as long as the Big W keeps it on the shelves.  Some folks are bound to try it, if for no other reason than the price, which is significantly cheaper than all of the well-known colas.  In my opinion, the carton and bottle designs (as well as the price) actually make this look like a knock-off, discount product.  We all know how nasty those knock-off colas taste, so don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that Big Red isn't worth a try.  This stuff is all kinds of good.  It is reportedly available in 43 states now, so keep an eye out for it - or just order some from this site.<br /><br />There is one issue you need to be aware of, though.  Big Red will turn your mouth red.  That includes the lips, so guys who drink this stuff should probably take a look at themselves in the mirror before heading out for a night on the town with their buddies - unless you want to take the chance of a lipstick joke or two thrown your way.  If I drink it at night, I have to wash off my lips inside and out to avoid waking up to a pillow sporting various red stains the next morning.  It's a small price to pay, though, for something that tastes as good as Big Red."

Then, he is right; he is ingesting more protein if he eats hemp with 20 grams. But due to the high quality of the chicken (roasted) breast at 136, I'd much rather get that 14.5 grams of chicken protein if my health depended upon it, instead of the 20 grams of hemp protein.<br /><br />!!! hemp protein is very weak in lysine and somewhat in tryptophan (according to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer, provides on their website after it is studied more than their presentation allows at face value -since it lists numbers but not human optimal requirements), only 55% of the ideal ratio of lysine to overall protein if I did this back of the envelope calc correctly, and both of these two essential amino acids are lacking.  That would give it around a protein quality of 55 when we are looking for over 100 in that measure. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well.  But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers.  In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy.  That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />Chicken, on the other hand, has a protein quality score of 136, almost reaching egg whites (145), and exceeding, soy and most other proteins, making it a much better quality protein - and he is correct in not getting caught up in the ""grams"". Then, there was a PhD student commenting on bioavailability of hemp protein and plant protein in general. He also is right and hemp's nutritional value can be overestimated by not looking at this. A good assumption for veggies is about 80% BV for veggie products compared to chicken, so that makes hemp worse than the 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said, hemp is great, you just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs. The feeling of being ""full"" has nothing to do with the quantity of protein as the other reviewer claimed he felt. As a matter of fact, fresh veggies are low in protein and people eat them to feel full - old dieting trick.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively ""low protein quality"" with other ""low quality"" proteins to get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route.<br /><br />But, hemp protein still has other amino acids below 100, so you are improving the two weakest points with a nutrient dense food like spinach to balance it out. I haven't checked the rest - and now it is time to say ""eat a well balanced diet"". Yogurt or whey protein will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy ... find some extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the pseudo hormones are diminished in the  alcohol extraction. Don't ask me where to buy it but it is out there.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better quality than hemp. As for eating too much protein in general, this can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out, especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins. The excess amino acids are disposed of by stressing the liver in extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver). So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted and converted into energy. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality are very important. Like for preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation.<br /><br />As a final note ... this hemp protein extract 50% powder (be sure to understand when you order which you are getting) goes better with smoothies unless you like eating a woody taste, but still has lots of fiber so just hope you acquire the taste.  Hope this helps...<br /><br />*This makes sense if that reviewer is comparing it to his 20 grams content of protein (40g hemp powder) of whatever he serves himself. If so (and it seems that way from the ambiguous talk of grams, serving size and exactly what is being measured), he is comparing 20 grams of hemp protein to the protein content in a 50 gram portion of chicken breast (who knows - maybe he means 50 grams chicken protein which would be a lot more chicken breast to eat and lots more protein)."

No problems with the Blue Buffalo, they really seemed to like that too, just needed lower caloric density to help us achieve our weigh goals for the dogs.

Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.

This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only ""taste tested"" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.
