0,"Has a clean fruity peach flavor that doesn't go flat like the Lemonade.  Takes a bit to dissolve completely so be patient, it's worth it.  I'm not a big ice tea fan in general but this has been a great substitute for diet colas.  Very economical and green as I don't need to drive to the store constantly and pay CRV on plastic bottles.  Doesn't require storage/handling like the 2 liter bottles either.  If they had sleeves like the ""On the Go"" variant instead of the tubs, it would be perfect."
1,"We got this as a sample in our new keurig elite. I plan on buying many more! Even my 6 year old likes drinking this with me. If you like tea, you can't go wrong with this!"
2,I was hopeful that this would be a good cup.  What I received was a very bitter cup with a very bad aftertaste.  I had to throw it out after a few sips.  This reminds me of the burnt beans that Starbucks roasts.  I am a an of strong coffee but not when the flavor is reached by burning the beans so badly that all you taste is the bitterness.  No thanks Emeril.
3,"I've planted about 30 seeds so far, and I'd estimate a near 100% germination rate. What else could you ask for?"
4,"I love ideal brown sugar substitute. Because it is from sugar alcohols it is natural, and unlike sorbitol or maltitol based substitutes, it doesn't affect my stomach. I use it on oatmeal and in baking to cut down on carbs. There is no aftertaste. My only complaint is that it is not clumpy like real brown sugar and that can sometimes affect baked goods, but so far I have had no problems with it!"
5,the taste is great and the nutrition is good.  I recommend it. I also like some other flavors and Cliff bars.
6,"So far there haven't been any worms in my rice though I've only opened a couple of the boxes. Besides just being boxed up, the rice has a thick plastic bag protecting it from any worms. I just wanted to up the rating of this a little because it does seem to be the cheapest wild rice on amazon even though the boxes are tiny."
7,"Good, but a little pricey. After I bought this one I found much cheaper one on Swanson Vitamins site. I would recommend to check other places for better price."
8,"I discovered this tea at PF Changs and had to have some!. I like it hot and I use it to make ice tea. I love it!!! It taste like peaches and apricots, but, not to overwhelming! I highly recommend it, even though it's spendy."
9,I looked forward to this tea and I don't know why.  I was disappointed in the flavor and I have made better tea myself by adding a drop of Anise candy flavoring to green tea.
10,"These are great for baking. They are creamer then the Carmel squares when you melt them and you do not have to unwrap them. I use them when I make Pecan Carmel Bars, they are great."
11,it's so unique getting the scoby that it's not even in the packaging and i don't care what the reason is. you can't show a picture and then the product that<br />i'm paying money for isn't in the packaging. i came to my senses since you can by a scoby for how much? i like to be fooled and maybe you do too. so please go<br />blow 45 dollars on a glass jar to then be told of some free claim for a scoby. no thanks.
12,"If you are wondering what this tastes like, it tastes 100% just like Jolly Rancher sour apple candy, only in a drink version.  For better or worse, the flavor is good but artificial.  It is somewhat refreshing, but I think about 6 ounces (about a juice glass) is the right amount.  I think if I drank a whole lot at once, I would get sick of it.<br /><br />Each package contains 5 packets which each make 2 quarts -- which is 2-1/2 gallons which is a lot.  4 packs = 10 gallons or about two dollars or so per gallon -- rather inexpensive.<br /><br />It is utterly simple to make.  The top of the packet easily tears off, and it is long and skinny to easily pour into any 1/2 gallon jar, bottle, etc.  It dissolves fairly rapidly.  Also, the plastic shrink-wrap easily removes/falls off, so you can reuse the oval container for whatever you want."
13,"I bought these not realizing that they were not the regular CLIF bars...I should have known because they are much too cheap the original ones, but I was pleasantly surprised with these... they come in packs of two, and they are like a regular granola bar as compared to the soft/chewy consistency of the original CLIF bars. I loved these though, and the white chocolate macadamia nut was so yummy! I would definitely buy these again! Great value. But very messy, so definitely not recommended for a breakfast while in the car! ha :)"
14,Hummus meal is a favorite! Everything is good.  I sent a pack of 6 to my daughter.  She likes them for a quick lunch at work or when she can't get back to the dorm in time for dinner.  I like them anytime! Highly recommended.
15,"I ended up comparing the value of this item, a little too late, after I had paid for it.  The size was wrong, the cost was ridiculous in comparison to any other<br />places selling the correct items.  You live and learn, I suppose."
16,"I'm a big fan of chicken tikka masala, and being far from any restaurants I searched and searched for something I could just reheat and chow down on.  I'd tried the Jyoti and found it tasted much to similar to MREs for my taste.<br />This stuff actually tastes like chicken tikka masala.  It's not perfect, but it's close enough.<br /><br />The biggest problem I had with it was the fact that they ship it with dry ice, and when that all evaporated... the boxes got soggy.  Compound this with the fact that the adhesive keeping the plastic covering on the bowl has the strength of watered down elmer's glue... I was in for a nasty mess when I opened the box.  So, out of the 12, I lost about three.<br /><br />I'm sure had I not shipped it all the way out to Iraq, they would have made it frozen and intact.  I'll probably end up buying more of these though."
17,"all natural,dogs favorite treat. Don't give too many because it will constipate dog. My dogs will do anything for these treats!"
18,"when you can't make your own or don't have the time this is perfect!<br />There are minimal ingredients, no preservatives.<br />I use it for this crock pot chicken [...]"
19,"If you like coconut water, this is for you! I had bought this product at a local market to try, while having chemo. Turns out the more i drank, the more i wanted! It has potassium in it, and some chemo makes you potassium deficient. So, i felt better drinking this product,along with lots of water, to say hydrated."
20,"Dave's Gourmet is known for its punchy hot sauces, but its pasta sauces are underrated... especially this one. Made in San Francisco from butternut squash harvested in Oregon's Willamette Valley, it's at once savory and sweet. It has such a filling flavor that even Parmesan cheese is beside the point. It's a great topping for gnocchi,pasta,etc. It's a wonderfully autumnal sauce. Bon appetit!"
21,"Not generally a huge fan of candy bars. I don't hate them, I just don't love them with the exception of reeses related products. I prefer nutrageous over fast break and crispy crunchy. This has become hard to find but I still saw them at Lewis today.  Also like reeses sticks and obviously, peanut butter cups."
22,"I bought a box of Drake's Devil Dogs. Unfortunately, the creme filling is some kind of cornstarch pudding mixture; very disappointing. We've enjoyed the original recipe for 50 yrs. I would not buy another box now."
23,"Please stay away from this product. I bought 3 of them, first one broke while it was hunging the first night i put it out.<br />Second one, lasted 2 weeks and trapped about 20 flies.<br />Material looks and feels cheap. Why did i ever buy this thing. Can't return the 3rd one because shipping will be more that the actual unit.<br />What a waist of time and money!"
24,"I'm addicted to Hershey chocolate; I admit it, but be warned, don't order this in the summertime unless you like chocolate goo."
25,"Each box has 5 sticks. Each stick is covered with chocolate sprinkles, and there's about 3 chambers which is filled with chocolate filling on the top and some sort of white filling on the bottom. This chocolate is extremely delicious.<br /><br />The crunchiness and the softness combine in a creamy paradise in your mouth.<br /><br />If you like this, you'll probably like Kinder Bueno as well."
26,"I loved the Tazo Organic Chai spiced black tea (at first). I brewed it a cup of hot water, no sweeteners. The tastes was good, it gave me a calming feeling, I felt mentally sharp, and could focus. However, the bad news is that 12 hours later, I could not sleep at night! I watched the clock tick all night long. After two days of this, I suspected the tea (as the only thing different in my routine). Since I have a personal and family history of hypertension (although under control by diet, medication, and exercise), I checked by BP that morning when I could not sleep: 148/98 and a pulse of 98! Something in that tea (I suspect) is interacting with my system. I don't ever want to go through this before., Has anyone else experienced this???"
27,"Vermont Country Blend is my favorite K-Cup. However, There were 2 different selections. Box of 24 for $24.25 and Box of 24 (Pack of 2) for $25.38.<br />I didn't see the (Pack of 2) for $1.13 more. Bummer!"
28,"Great item has many uses! I use it in my hair, on my body as a moisturizer, in my food and also as a supplement. It's the best and for a very good price."
29,"Having to drink decaf is easier with a hearty,bold , yet not bitter coffee ! Closest to Starbucks decaf if you like that type of stronger flavor. Have tried a lot of k-kup decafs and this is the best yet."
30,"I love the way I feel drinking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00566HYH0"">Energy Green SuperFood Powder- 100 Servings - 24.7 oz - Powder</a> I buy this big one to refill my small one<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TJERRG"">Amazing Grass Energy Green Superfood Lemon Lime Flavor, 7.4-Ounce Tub</a>. This is more convenient to get into for my daily drinks. Then i keep the big one in the fridge and the little one i leave out. It does dry out some by the end of the week. Its just much easier for me.<br /><br /> I love the boost of energy i get from this drink.I have been out for a couple days and definitely notice a drop in my energy.The energy is not a jolt like caffeine but more like a natural feeling of well being with a kick of endurance. I feel Amazing on this stuff.<br /><br />  I also drink the chocolate. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J9LX48"">Amazing Grass Chocolate Drink Powder, Green Superfood, 17-Ounce Container</a>It has amazing health benefits and has brought my PH into the normal range. without the chocolate my PH came up but not to normal.."
31,"Shipped fast and packed well. This is a terrific cereal bar and low cal. It has a great taste and texture. everyone who tries them, loves them. Can't wait to try another flavor."
32,"I love these cookie - I mean biscuits.  Not only are they tasty, there is something about the texture that makes them especially yummy.  I ordered the seven pack and they all came nicely wrapped with very minimal breakage."
33,"As a very health oriented person I've never really been very interested in normal coffee, but have at various times dabbled in different coffee alternatives.<br /><br />Although many of the other coffee alternatives aren't bad, I can't really say that I was all that interested in them. Where Ayurvedic Roast is different, is that I really enjoy drinking it; it has a wonderful vanilla aroma, and a deep rich flavor.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, my mom, who very much _is_ a coffee drinker actually really likes it too, so I always make sure to keep a good amount in stock in case she comes by :)"
34,"It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already..."
35,"If you are looking for a protein fill drink, full of good karma, this is for you.  I love Chai.  If you love Chai, that spicy, sweet goodness in a glass, then you are going to go nuts for this drink.  I like their other flavors, but this one is definitely the best!"
36,I am a coffee addict.  Yet the jitters can really detract from my work - both professionally and at home.  This tea provides the kick to keep me going without the jitters.<br /><br />I love this stuff.
37,It's bland while you're drinking it without any real chocolate or hazelnut flavor and leaves a horrible aftertaste once you've drank it.
38,I have tried many pre-workouts and there are only a few that I trust for quality. It provides a great pump and energy to make it through my workouts without making me jittery. It might not give you the rage feeling like Noxipro or 1MR but I sleep better at night knowing what I am putting in my body. I switch between this and Muscle Pharm's Assault.
39,It is probably the only falafel that a celiac can eat and it is so delicious.
40,Good to purchase in a larger quantity! Ease for keeping supplies in stock! Easy to obtain from Amazon without a third party involved.  Got to use my free shipping - yea.
41,"My daughter loves these - she has celiac disease and really loves having ""normal"" mainstream foods. They are great for gluten free rice krispie treats!"
42,"I found this to be a very smooth and somewhat rich coffee.  Very enjoyable with good flavor, but not with a lot of depth or darkness.  Ethiopia has produced some of the best coffee in the world, and while this may not be the best I have ever tasted, it is a very good medium roast, full flavored coffee without a lot of bitterness.  This is the best cup of pod coffee I have tasted so far.<br /><br />In addition to the pod brewer, I also tried this coffee pod in a pour-through basket with boiling water and also steeping it like a cup of tea and found that the flavor was pretty consistent, if not better when brewed outside of the pod brewer (I was able to steep the coffee much stronger and to higher yield in a cup with boiling water -but slower than the pod brewer).  The pods are marked with which side up/down and should be tucked down tight in the pod brewer for the best results.  Each pod is individually wrapped airtight, and tasted as fresh as any other pre-ground or pod coffee I have tried.  Sustainably grown."
43,"The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'."
44,I don't know why you can't find these much any more. When I do I stock up. I hate the sweet candy coated PopTarts as you find mostly today. Both the product and the service from Amazon were great.
45,Love the rich flavor and good taste.  Strong but not bitter.  Would also recommend Starbuck Cafe Verona which is fabulous.  Never was a Starbuck's fan but this kcup won me over.
46,"Wow!  I cannot believe that so much<br /><br />good healthy stuff could be in such<br /><br />a small package! The calorie count,<br /><br />etc. would help others choose this<br /><br />unique food bar."
47,"Bought these after reading the reviews.  They are tasty (a little strange at first but they really grow on you).  One nice thing is that for me, I can eat them as a chip alternative but I don't eat too many.  About 10-15 crisps and I'm done.  I have also used them in salads.<br /><br />I bought a case here and I don't think I'll do that again.  I've seen them at my grocery store and I'll buy a bag now and then.  For now I have a big box full in the closet.  I think it will take a while to get through them."
48,"I opened one of these terra chip bags and to my surprise, 6 crummy pieces of broken chips were in there. Not even 6 whole chips. 6 chip fragments. Plus, the chips looked totally stale. I returned the bag to the store immediately upon opening it."
49,"I have found the plant sterol margarines and the Benecol chews leave a horrible waxy film in my mouth. These cookies are really great - they taste good and no wax. They are a bit grainy but the flavor is really good and there are lots of chocolate chips, which really makes up for the graininess. 1.3 g of of plant sterols, 4 g of soluble fiber, 4 WW Pts+."
50,"this is what smoked meat in montreal tastes like - it's nor pastrami or corned beef. it comes in 5 packets so it stays fresh. all the information is in the description so i'm not sure what the confusion is. if you're looking for really good montreal smoked meat, here it is."
51,"Amazon shipped this quick, but the carton was a little damaged on the corner but didn't affect the cake, so I kept it. The cake was not that fresh compared to the ones I bought while traveling in the Caribbean, it was kinda dry. The taste was good but the orange was overpowering so you really didn't taste much of the rum. I would not order again this one."
52,"According to the manufacture the xylitol used in this gum is produced in the USA from birch, not GMO corn from China. This gum has a pleasant taste it is not too strong or over powering. Xyloburst, like most xylitol gum does not have long lasting flavor, but it does last long enough and it does not get rock hard once the flavor is gone so you can chew it for a while. The gum does a great job of controlling  bad breath/ refreshing your breath after meals. The added oral hygiene benefits you get from the xylitol is also a plus. I have been chewing this gum for a while and I have nothing bad to report,"
53,"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
54,"I order dozens of products from Amazon every month and this is the first time I truly am compelled to review a product I had purchased.<br /><br />Wow. How difficult is it really to mess up a chewing gum? Well, this gum is plain disgusting. Within seconds it melts in your mouth into gooey mess that stick to your teeth and tongue. I tried using 2-3 pieces at the time, and the results was even worse. Unsure if I was given an old batch, but after I tried 10 pieces, I tossed the rest. By far the worst purchase I had ever made on Amazon. Gross.  What a waste of money."
55,"This is truly a wonderful experience in a cup.  I absolutely love this coffee.  Folgers hasn't failed me yet.  Chocolate Truffle not only smells delicious but TASTES delicious.  After trying a few other brands from online purchases that were a complete letdown, I have to say my tastebuds have been redeemed.  3 12oz bags for $16 and change is is good buy for flavored coffee.  I'll be back for more.  Thanks Folgers and thank you Amazon for providing customers a Folger's selection thanks really good."
56,"I ordered this for my son's birthday party, which was bumblebee themed. We gave them as favors to all the kids, and the parents thought they were so cleverly packaged in the bumblebee foil. We were getting nervous about delivery, but customer service was great, and they arrived in time!"
57,"i actually prefer their ""original"" blend, but that's just me.  consumer reports rated this product EXTREMELY highly, and they were right.  bokar blend also good.  my new standard.  AVOID PRETENTIOUS CRAP.  so unpretentious and uncool it's almost pretentious and cool."
58,Got this for my granddaughter who loves this food and goes nuts when she sees the box.  I recommend this snack over the normal mushy stuff that's out there even though this is not a good teething biscuit.  Granddaughter likes to practice biting so this is great.  We don't have to worry about choking; it melts fairly quickly in the mouth.  Enjoy. It comes in different flavors too.
59,"I have been using this flavor wheatgerm for 37 years and now find myself living in an area where it is not sold anywhere. I have asked 2 managers of 2 different grocery stores to order it for me and they said they couldn't. When I was in Florida a couple of years ago I bought every jar they had in the local grocery store just so I would have it for awhile. A few months ago I ran out and decided to see if it was on Amazon never imagining it actually was. I was so pleasantly suprised to find it here. Now I never have to worry about running out again! My son and I use this product to sprinkle on stew, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and macaroni salad. It adds a nice flavor and texture. It is a staple in my life just as much as pepper or ketchup."
60,I CANT REVIEW THIS FOOD...BECAUSE THE KIBBLE SIZE IS  H  U  G  E<br />UNLESS YOU HAVE A GIGANTIC DOG....I DO NOT THINK YOUR SM-MED DOG WILL WANT TO CHEW THESE! IM SO UPSET BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE CAN OF THIS WANTED TO MIX THE SAME AS CAN WITH THE DRY!
61,"There is another brand of organic rooibos tea offered on Amazon (Choice brand) that I previously ordered.  I gave that tea 5 stars.  Numi also offers a good rooibos.<br /><br />I decided to give Davidson's a chance since it was so cheap.  Now I understand why it's so cheap.  It is extremely weak tea.  2 bags of Davidson's is still not equal to 1 bag of Choice.  Maybe 3 or 4 bags is more like it.<br /><br />I actually ended up throwing out my most recent cup of Davidson's because I had left 2 old bags in there, along with 2 new bags (so 4 bags in total) thinking that maybe I could suck more tea out of the old bags (something I did quite often with the other brands).  But the joke was on me because what the tea ended up tasting like was the bags themselves with just a hint of tea.<br /><br />I feel that drinking this brand of rooibos tea is more like drinking plain water with just the hint of tea flavor.  I doubt I will drink the remaining 96 bags I have left but will instead use them for my tired eyes when I go to bed at night."
62,Of course dogs love Greenies!  I was happy to find I could get them right from Amazon since I live in a remote area.
63,"I think this product is good, but my puppy does not go well with this product.  She got loos stool and stinky gas all the time.  I needed to change the food."
64,"I ordered these as an alternative to canned pears, and they don't taste taste exactly like canned pears. While I like them canned, I found I like these even better. The light syrup gives it a nice flavor. What I like most about these is the texture of the fruit retains a lot of the crunchiness of a fresh pear, while most canned pears are soft throughout. So to me, this product is something like a hybrid of fresh pears and canned pears. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and will order again. 4 stars for the relatively expensive price, but otherwise a 5 star product."
65,"This hot cocoa tastes very artificial, like fake sweetener. I could barely finish a cup of it, it was that gross. Buy at your own risk."
66,"The box of slim jims was received in good condition,and there where no bad surprizes. The taste of the slim jims was just what I remember from when I was a small kid over 50 years ago, although the size of the product has gotten smaller, it still tastes the same."
67,These little chips are fabulous. They taste like Ranch Doritos!! Wonderful flavor. Great for salads or crush as use as breading on chicken.
68,"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
69,"*****<br /><br />Numi Tea's Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified organic high mountain Yunnan Black Tea FOP (Flowery Orange Pekoe). There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""This noble tea is grown in the mist covered mountains of Yunnan province. What distinguishes this fine, organic black tea is its perfect sense of balance, exquisite tiger's eye color, and a lean vibrancy which makes it suitable at any time of day. Like a complex wine, it is the perfect tea for food, marrying well with a wide variety of dishes. It has a distant and hard to place floral quality, yet it leaves the mouth tasting as clean as spring water. And it energizes the body and mind more harmoniously than the best of coffees. We are proud to bring you this high grade leaf.""<br /><br />Although this tea says ""orange pekoe"", it does not taste citrus-y, but has a strong morning black tea taste with flowery overtones.  It is like a regular orange pekoe upgraded many, many times, with something delicate, lovely, and flowery added.  It's the perfect morning tea, or for anytime you want a high-quality pick-me-up.<br /><br />The price is super, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love regular black, this will probably be the best you've ever had, and you'll wonder why you ever drank the ""old stuff""!<br /><br />*****"
70,"I like Special K, but this product loses its crunch very quickly. It turns starchy and is like eating sweet mush. I won't be ordering this again. In fact, I will probably throw away the few cups I have remaining."
71,I bought two of this bottles because I liked the principle but ended up realizing that this toy was basically designed for puppies.<br />The two bottles I bought lasted no more than two weeks with my German Sheppard.<br />The main problem is that this bottle is hit on the floor and walls at the time the dog is trying to get the kibble out of it. It cracks and is basically a dangerous toy for adult dogs that will end up eating part of the plastic.
72,"I have been having difficulty finding this blend at local stores. After trying many different flavors over the past 18 months, I find this the most enjoyable blend yet, followed closely by Kona blend. Thanks to Amazon for carrying this blend at an affordable price."
73,"I have been buying this brand for the past 3 years. I am a Kona Lover, but have issues with spending 200 dollars for a 5 pound bag (I have the money but I much rather give it to charity than drink it). This brand almost gives you the Aroma of the higher quality Kona, even though it is a Blend, but for a lot lower cost. It has a perfect medium brew. Recommend it highly."
74,"My mom-in-law had rec'd 1 box of these in a gift box, but couldn't find more when she found she enjoyed the convenience of them in her hot tea & on toast.  She said the straws are just the right amount, they are less messy & the honey keeps longers than in a jar.  A 6-pk was a great surprise for her.  The price was reasonable for a convenience item."
75,"Nice robust flavor especially for a morning blend. The price is incredible, about a quarter cheaper per cup compared to a standard k cup. I was a bit nervous about how they would work in my cuisinart brewer. Not a problem, they work flawlessly. I'll be ordering a lot more."
76,"I actually used this on one of my chocolate cakes and it was beautiful! It gave off a beautiful glitter shimmer. The only problem I had was that it was a little messy. It's kind of hard to get off surfaces if you get it on the table or something. It also sticks to your fingers when spreading it on your baking goods, but that's not much of a problem because you can easily wash that off. If you are afraid that it's too expensive for the small amount of glitter, I can tell you that a little glitter can go along way. :)  I will be buying more different colored glitter from this brand."
77,I bought this when my daughter started eating food...around 6 months of age.  It works great although it doesn't make a large amount of food...maybe enough for 3 servings.  But now that I've been using it for about 4 months I noticed the drive shaft is looking a little blackish/rusty and leaking black which spills into the food when you pour it out.  I tried to take out the drive shaft before I poured it out but the taste of the food doesn't taste right.  I can't feed the food to my baby any longer using this machine.  I'm going to return it and probably just make it the old fashioned way.  If you want to try a baby processor try another brand.
78,"Since I starting drinking Baja Bob's I now take the packets with me when going out to dinner and ask the bartender to make my drink with Baja Bob's.  When I first did this 5 years ago, they balked.  It seems like more bartenders are understanding that women (and guys too) don't want the extra calories.  I love the taste -- not as sweet as a regular margarita, and that works so much better for me!"
79,"FLAVOR: PINK LEMONADE<br />-it definitely tastes like pink lemonade<br />-consistency is thick, it's like you're drinking lemon syrup<br />-i hate the orange flavor, this is definitely an improvement<br /><br />EFFECTIVENESS: FAST, I DID FEEL TIRED AFTER A FEW HOURS THOUGH<br />-perks you up within 15-20 minutes<br />-after 3-4 hours, I definitely noticed my limbs feeling like lead (felt sluggish)<br /><br />PRICE: DECENT<br />-12 bottles (24 oz)<br />-can find cheaper energy supplements that are just effective<br /><br />OVERALL: if you're a big fan of 5 hour energy but not the flavor, you might enjoy this... there are cheaper alternatives on amazon though, I prefer<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017O19Q2"">STAY ALERT Military Caffeine Energy Gum - ARCTIC MINT </a> (caffeine-based) since it works faster (and freshens my breath! but doesn't last as long), and if you don't like caffeine/gum, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTQAE"">Hansen's Energy Pro Drink</a> (works better than 5 hour energy)."
80,"Anyone remember that old joke about Grey Poupon that involved two old sophisticated men in a limousine?  I remember that commercial with fond memories, and in fact is the main reason I avoided eating it for so long for fear that I'd become exactly like those men.  Good thing it was just a big joke and *anyone* can eat this stuff without desiring to feel high and mighty!<br /><br />The taste is good but it's not as appealing as it used to be.  I believe they're either making it cheaper these days or simply have changed their recipe for the worse.  Either way old time fans of this product that have been neglecting it over the years may be in for quite the disappointing surprise when they go to eat this overpriced stuff."
81,"Tried this when it went on sale for $1.00/box and kicking myself for not buying in quantity! I eat very little flesh food and this broth was a blessing in disguise for pressure cooking beans and other vegetarian fare. Unfortunately, Amazon is not competitive with the local supermarkets as I can drive about a mile and buy for $3.00.box."
82,"My sister, who is a coffee lover, told me about Tully's Italian.  Now, it's my favorite k-pod.  Not too dark and not too light.....just right.  The only thing to would improve it would be if it was Organic."
83,"Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.  Had to get creative with storing so much tea in my cupboard, but for the amount you get, the price cannot be beat. Highly recomended!"
84,"I enjoy eating spicy food with my girlfriend, and we have tried many different levels of spicy food (ghost pepper sauce, etc). These chips get pretty spicy about 1/2 through one of the 2-ounce bags and they have a good taste too!"
85,"I just re-ordered this decaf coffee.  We have tried several decaf varieties looking for that perfect cup.  The Donut House is our reigning favorite.  We had been drinking Donut SHOP decaf and just tried Green Mountain Breakfast Blend decaf.  While both of these coffees are pleasant, neither compares to the Donut House in aroma or flavor.  This coffee is full bodied in taste and very smooth.  We brew it on the 8oz setting and think that is perfect, although we make the next size larger for my mother who likes her's a bit weaker.  We'll probably keep looking for the perfect decaf; this one is excellent."
86,This condiment is one I keep in my desk at work.  Sometimes I stop by a local grocery chain deli and pick up a pre-made sandwich for lunch since I know I won't have time to go out. The Beaver Brand Cranberry Mustard really dresses up an ordinary turkey breast sandwich. A nice combination of tart/sweet cranberry plus the zing of good deli mustard.
87,"Our rescue black lab/hound mix had parasites when we first got her so we knew she needed a good quality food.  We started her out on Blue Buffalo and even after the parasites completely cleared her body, she was still pooping 5+ times a day and nothing solid.  We slowly switched her over to the Organix and she hasn't had a single stomach issue since. We are very fortunate to have found such good quality food and food that she actually enjoys eating!! She is very healthy now and her coat is beautiful and soft as ever. It is costly but you can't put a price on the well-being of a loved one.  Only wish we had started her on it sooner to save her 2 months of misery.  Highly recommend this product!!"
88,"We love these snacks! My son is 13 months old and just gobbles them up.<br />I echo a few other reviewers here though, these are not for younger babies. They're very crunchy.<br />The packaging is great, small enough to stuff in the diaper bag."
89,"It has a hint of Jasmine in the tea flavor. I enjoy it.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000R4G4TU"">Bigelow Green Tea with Jasmine 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
90,"This is a pretty neat concept, rewarding your dog with licks rather than treats, to cut down calorie consumption.  However, it's only good if your dog likes it.  Mine doesn't.  To be fair, he's 8 years old and set in his ways."
91,"These lollipops are are well done, look exactly like the picture. Not a single one was broken! They packaged each lollipop so nicely, very impressed!"
92,"Personally, I prefer grating my own cheese right before pasta dinners, but this product makes for a nice condiment at the table or when you don't have a block of fresh cheese to grate. The flavor is pretty nice, goes nicely with spaghetti sauce or as an garnish to other things like chicken."
93,"I found that this tea really helped increase my milk supply. It tasted a little funny at first, but I quickly got used to it. The price on Amazon is unbeatable, especially if you use subscribe and save."
94,Amazing smooth flavor.  I use this mixed with skim milk and a high protein powder to make a wonderful iced coffee smoothie.  It is the breakfast of champions!!
95,"Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available, we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area!  It appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting, lightly salted, lower calorie popcorn, but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film.  This popcorn pops fully, leaving no kernels unpopped, and doesn't need any additives.  Ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it!  Thank you, [...]!"
96,ok so i love chocolate!!! then again who doesn't? they shipped it fast and none of the chocolates were melted!:) They were absolutely delicious and a wonderful box of delicacies!
97,"This is the BEST ""jerk"" seasoning around!  Forget the dry rubs and the jerk ""sauces"".  This seasoning is so flavorful you DON'T need a lot!!!  A little too much and you feel the ""heat"".  Use 1/2 teaspoon rubbed on a steak, chicken or pork is all you need!! A jar lasts forever.  You can also use it as a marinade by mixing some with more oil (instead of rubbing it on directly) but personally I think that's wasteful.  Rub it on, grill it, bake it, anyway you do it you'll LOVE IT!"
98,"I really don't like the fact that they are made in china.<br />Even if its organic, I don't feel comfortable that it's from china so I probably wont get it anymore..."
99,"We've been gluten free for awhile and I've experimented with different mixes and making from scratch.  Everyone has their own definition of the ""perfect"" chocolate cookie, this one is pretty close to mine.<br /><br />I absolutely love them.  They were chewy, had a nice rise to them, and the finished cookie tasted great.  As other reviewers have said, there aren't a lot of chocolate chips in them, so you could always add your own.<br /><br />The dough does feel differently, but when you start in gluten free baking, you have to get over the expectation that recipes will mix up the same as the ones with regular flour.  I did smell and taste the fava bean in the dough, but once they were baked I couldn't at all.  I don't think someone could tell these were gluten free at all if I didn't tell them."
100,"I purchased this product for it's probiotics, but found it difficult to disguise the sour taste.  Lifeway's flavored products were a much better option.  This product can make a good substitute for sour cream as far as taste goes.  It has a much thinner consistancy though."
101,"I studied the Keurig machines and others for over 2 months before deciding on this one.  My main fear on the Keurig was the unbelievable amount of bad reviews for the water pumps failing.  Their home systems (especially the platinum) seem to be plagued with this issue, yet this unit and most of the other commercial units appear immune.  The downside to going with the commercial unit is they are not compatible with the ""My K-cup"".  Do not despair.. there is a solution!<br /><br />My experience:<br /><br />I purchased a B145 from the local Staples for $129.99!!  I unwrapped my new beauty and filled it full of water per the instructions.  My heart sank as the just out of the box unit would not prime.  I figured I must be doing something wrong and called Keurig.  They confirmed the unit was defective... right out of the box!!  Not happy, but I thought I would give it one more go.  I took it back to Staples, who happily exchanged the item.  This time success. The unit works great and I have had no other issues in the month of ownership.  Use of filtered or bottled water highly recommended to extend the unit service life.  Unit has a 1 year warranty from Keurig so I am very happy with my purchase so far.<br /><br />Those who complained about the noise surprised me a bit.  It does hum and buzz a bit I admit... but it lasts what.. maybe 40 seconds while it fills with water.  Really? .. seemed a bit silly to me.<br /><br />Now, the big win here... I was willing to trade the inability to use the ""My K-cup"" for a reliable unit, but found the eKobrew reusable filter for Keurig here on Amazon. It works great with the B145 and I recommend it if you want to use your own blend of coffee.<br /><br />For what it is worth... that's my 2 cents."
102,"If I could give this product no stars I would.  We have been giving this dog food to our dogs for years.  But for the past month or so when the formula was changed and put on the shelf our dog has been having an allergic reaction to something.  At first we thought it was just allergies as dogs like humans, change as they get older.  As he was the only one to have problems.  We tried cleaning our patio on a daily basis. Bought new food and water bowls to stainless steel.  Wash the water bowl as much as possible.<br /><br />We even took him to the vet NUMEROUS times.  Our vet, which has been practicing for over 25 years and is the best in our area was puzzled when nothing worked.  Our dog started to lose his fur, has odd looking spots all over, under his chin he has open sores that do not go away no matter how much we wash and put medicine on it, and he's consistently scraching and making it worse.  In between his toes it's red and inflamed, in his ears are a bright red color like a rash.  Lastly, he hasn't been eating as much and has been having diarreah.  A week later our other dog broke out in hives and had to be rushed to the emergency room.  They gave her shots and they slowly went away.  But now she is starting to experience the same problems as our other dog.<br /><br />The last time we went down to the pet store to pick up his food we over heard other customers yelling about the food making their dog sick.  We heard all of the same symptoms as I just described above and the shop owner didn't know why and has taken the food off of the shelf, and had given them a refund.  We decided to not buy any more canidae but to go online and do some research.<br /><br />We have found out that Canidae has changed their formula and has added many new ingredients.  All of which are grains such as millet, that MOST dogs are allergic to.  We have found other forums of people describing the same issues that they're having with their dogs just like we are.  When we called customer service they did nothing and blamed us for our dogs reaction to the food.  When I asked how is it our fault for your inadequte labeling on the bag in which the food is in when we buy it?  And how is it our fault when we've been using your dog food for the last 7 years? There was no response, the ""customer service representative"" if you can call her that, simply said ""if you don't like it then don't buy it."" And then she hung up on me.<br /><br />The bag never changed it's appearance nor did they add any ""stickers"" to indicate a change in their formula.  If there had been I would have checked to make sure that what they changed it to wouldn't affect my dogs, or at the very lest I would have known what signs to watch for and change this terrible food to something different if they had a reaction as they did.  I feel this horrible company should have to pay for my vet bills as they did not inform us the consumers of their changes.  I understand I choose to have pets, and purchase their foods, but I did not choose to change a formula that was fine just the way it was.  Could the reason for changing the formula was to make it cheaper for them to produce??  How about just increasing the price of the dog food if that was the case, because I would have kept purchasing it.  Should they see the light and go back to their old formula my family will never purchase it again just like the many others that I'm sure will not.<br /><br />I have now chosen a food for them that is GRAIN FREE and they are now starting to chow down like they once did.  We will have a long recovery road ahead for our male dog as his coat and face has it the worst.  My hope is that anyone looking to buy this food find out about what the formula has done to others animals like mine before they buy it."
103,"CarbRite Brownie Mix includes chocolate chips in it - and the resulting brownies are only 1.5 grams of net carbs per large brownie!  That's only 174 calories. This is definitely recommended for anyone who loves chocolate and wants to be healthy too.<br /><br />The brownies are very easy to make. You add in 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of butter and a teaspoon of water. That's it. Bake for just under an hour, then chill for an hour in the fridge.<br /><br />What's neat about the brownies is you have options as to how they come out. Depending on how long you bake them, you can get them to be more cake like or fudge like. We like them about half and half.<br /><br />The chocolate chips seem to ""sink"" into the mix, which gives it the fudgy aspect on the bottom layer. It's a really nice texture, with a crispy top. Even several days later, the ones that are left (assuming you eat them at a reasonable pace) are still quite tasty.<br /><br />Now I do want to comment that you SHOULD eat them only one at a time. My boyfriend was a bit greedy when we first made these, and ate a bunch. These are LOADED with sugar alcohols.  There are 15g of sugar alcohols per serving. This gives it a fantastic sweet flavor - but they cause digestive problems if eaten in large quantities. One brownie is fine. Six brownies .... less fine. Be wise. Eat just one.<br /><br />Some people ask me why they don't just use Splenda instead of sugar alcohols. Splenda doesn't bake as well as sugar alcohols do - the flavor comes out differently. I really do believe this is the best formulation for its fantastic flavor, but again, be aware of the content. Eat in moderation.<br /><br />I really love these. You get a rich brownie flavor for hardly any calories and almost zero carbs. It really is quite ideal for anybody who loves chocolate - on any eating plan - who wants to avoid sugar.<br /><br />The nutrition values are: 174 calories, 12g fat (no trans fats), 55mg sodium, 3g fiber, 15g sugar alcohols, 1.5g net carbs. You get tiny amounts of some vitamins, nothing to really consider important.<br /><br />I would even recommend parents make these for their kids, if their kids demand chocolate, rather than giving them sugary versions."
104,It is a good produckt Iam using it for the last four weeks .It has very nice smell to it.
105,i actually tried this cookie through influenster is was really chewy which is how i like my cookies i dont like them hard and crunchy its very good but the after taste left in you mouth is kinda nasty but overall one good cookie
106,"Asian spice lovers rejoice. I squirt this tasty red stuff on pretty much everything from hot dogs, Chinese take-out, cheeseburgers, eggs, fries, tacos, etc. You can't go wrong and the bottle is 110% mess-free. Everybody needs a bottle of the Sriracha in their cabinet. I stocked up on several dozen in case of apocalypse."
107,My son loves to eat these in his lunch. He also uses them to dip with his applesauce. These are great healty snacks. Better order 2 cartons because you will eat them quickly!
108,"The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable."
109,There are miles between me and my family. As a surprise I try to send my niece and nephew an off the wall gift from time to time!  I sent this one and they loved it.  The delivery was fast and the contents fresh! Will send again in the future.
110,"I have sampled various types of Starbucks flavored coffee over the years, and I have found that Starbucks coffee, no matter what the flavor, is usually very consistent.  Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.<br />I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.<br />Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee."
111,"I am not by any means a vegetarian (I eat my steaks rare), but I do try to eat healthy.  Beef jerky is a great snack if you are on the go (I travel a lot), but the constant intake of red meat is not good for you.  So, I tried the Primal Strip vegan strips.  I have had every one that they make.....and they are all good.  The Thai Satian Peanut is by far my favorite (the hot and spicy shiitake mushroom jerky is my second favorite).  I have recommended this snack to even the most devout meat eaters and they even like it.  I give it 5 stars - but just like everything - they are not for everyone.  I recommend buying them individually first, and if you love it then come back to amazon and get a box (amazon is the cheapest for the boxes)."
112,"el sabroso salsitas chips.  pleased as i am most of time. great flavor, great service."
113,I use this products often for Gluten free coffee cake. It is easy to use and a hit every time I make a coffee cake for a social function. I like a good coffee cake once in awhile. Being Gluten Free can be challenging but Pamela's Mix has helped easy the burden of having multiple different types of Gluten Free Flour on hand.
114,This coffee has a nice flavor; I usually don't like Brazilian coffee.<br />This coffee has a full warm flavor.<br />The quality seems very good.<br />The price is super.
115,Love these chips.  Good for a quick snack and I don't fee TOO guilty eating them since they have less fat and salt than regular chips.  Highly recommended.
116,"This is the best bold coffee on the market. Rich, strong, with no after bite. You will not be disappointed. Great value. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a strong, tasteful coffee."
117,I ordered 8 cans of the wheat and honey 400g CERELAC but got 8 cans of the NESTUM 300g cans. The diiference in sizes wont have been as much of an issue as the difference in taste and consistency.<br /><br />Do not order from this seller. The product shown is NOT what u will recieve.
118,"If you are addicted to potato chips, or just love snacks, you may want to grab some of these.  I picked up my first bag at a store about 80 miles from home because they are low in fat.  The flavor is excellent and they are crisp and fresh packed in what looks like a foil package.  At only 4 grams of fat per ounce, these are the best flavored chips I have found.<br />Buying from Amazon brings the chips to my door at less cost than buying at a local store and I don't need to spend my time or money for transportation to get them. They are well packaged in the box and each bag is sealed with a volume of air that keeps it from squashing and breaking the contents in transit.<br />All in all a great flavorful low-fat snack that hits the spot.  if there is any negative at all, it is that with 12 bags in the cabinet, I need to ration them to myself so I don't pig-out on them.  Enjoy !"
119,The price on these rolls is double the normal suggested retail price from the manufacturer.  The rolls can be bought anywhere selling them for $8.19/roll!!
120,great added to your morning coffee!  Doesn't add all the sugar like the regular hot cocoa mix!  Moca low cal
121,"Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" is not much more than window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."
122,Herradura has been in business since 1870 and this very smooth tequila shows that tradition of craftsmanship. Herradura Reposado is as equally nice for sipping as it is for using in classic Margarita recipes. We like blending it with Herradura silver and anejo!
123,"Just bought some of these the other day. If you are looking for a dog treat that is nutritious and will keep your pet entertained, this is it!  So glad this product is available on Subscribe & Save!"
124,"This tastes almost *exactly* like a Red Bull. The color of the beverage is nearly clear/light pink.<br /><br />If the price was more in line with a Red Bull, I'd probably buy these instead. At twice the price however, one was enough to satisfy my curiosity."
125,"Both easy and delicious - I truly enjoy all of the ""Mama"" brand Thai soups."
126,"You gave me a package that was already opened with one bar missing.  NOT cool.  If this happens again, I am not ordering from you anymore."
127,"For the taste, I'd give 4 or 4.5 stars. Pretty good, tastes a little bit like raspberry cheesecake (thought I mostly think it's like a yogurt flavor).<br /><br />Problem with this bar is that it's way too soft. It gets crushed/flattened in my pocket, bag, or anywhere else. Even when I'm unwrapping a new bar, it falls apart in the wrapper as I'm opening it! This doesn't affect the taste much, but it does hurt the portability of this snack item.<br /><br />Also, being a 90 calorie bar, it's not the greatest for satisfying hunger."
128,"I bought this syrup from a local store and decided to try it. I liked the taste of the syrup. However, I had no idea that maltitol was going to cause me terrible discomfort soon. I didn't even have a full serving which is a 1/4 cup (I believe). After I looked up the ingredients and googled maltitol, I realized that it was the cause of ALL my intestinal discomfort that day. I felt terrible and was in pain. Needless to say, the bottle went straight to the trashcan. So, unless you know for sure that sugar alcohols don't bother you I wouldn't try it."
129,"This stuff tastes great! I am not a decaf person, but perhaps I am being won over by Melitta coffee - try it!"
130,"These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving)."
131,"Minus the chef celebrity endorsement of this product, they really are awesome!  I use these things so much that it's a wonder they're not coming out my ears.  These go into recipes, on top of recipes, into soups, stews, you name it, we use it.  I love these for dips for parties too - I still think they have the best taste of all these buttery crackers and we just also use them to snack on.  Still my preference after all these years, been using them for years, and don't plan on changing anytime soon.  Highly, highly recommend!"
132,Just as I remember them..the BOMB! Doesn't expire til october and I recevied 4 boxes. A little steep 13 bucks but hey they are soo good.and I'm happy I know where they sale them now.overall satisified!!!
133,"This product is simply for cheap liquor since taste and quality is not important!  I prefer to drink my Grey Goose straight; however, on occasion it is absolutely delicious with a very tiny splash of olive juice.  This product was a a quick fix for me to stop purchasing olives in order to use the juice.  It's not worth it!!  The after taste is worse!!"
134,"I bought these because we had great luck with another brand of gluten-free cookies and thought these were worth a try also.  They were TERRIBLE, so bad in fact that nobody would eat them.  I contacted Amazon and they graciously refunded me.  I will stick with the original brand from now on, even if these are less expensive."
135,My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product. The only bad thing is that it will make your dog fat if he eats too much.
136,"My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.  Well I started noticing Jitterbug was leaving small little balls of poo all over the house!  Instead of taking him to the vet and paying a lot of money on tests I thought I'd try this expensive food first and what do you know, no more poop balls!  It's too bad it's so pricey, but if I don't have to deal with feces outside the litter box, I'll pay top dollar.  My cat has been on this formula for a month now and I'm very pleased with the results."
137,These cookies are awesome.  Great for dieters and those cutting out sugar.  So good!  You won't miss your old Oreos at all.
138,"I like bolder strong coffee, so I thought I'd give this a try, and boy am I glad. Sometime when coffee gets stronger it can get bitter, but not this, it is still smooth and rich. I drink my coffee black, so I am fussy, but this is a great anytime cup when you need that little  lift."
139,"I recently discovered this product and my kids LOVE it! It is such a new and innovative format for my 4 year old.  When she was younger, she loved yogurt melts but now that she is a ""big kid"", she refuses to eat those melts because they are for babies.  Yo'Drops are crunchy, flavorful yogurt drops that feel like candy but are super healthy.  They are individually packed so I can throw a few packs in my purse when we are on the go.  I also keep a box of these in my car when my kids are are cranky and need a light, healthy snack in between meals."
140,"Reviewing an established candy treat such as Peanut Chews Originals seems unnecessary, but I purchased 12 5-ounce bags recently and Amazon wants a review. Now this candy has been around for decades and so have I, but since I first tasted it as a kid in the 1950s, it's been a favorite. And I've always consumed it slowly -- I'd pop one of those chocolate covered sections into my mouth and make it last. First the chocolate melts away, then the caramel slowly dissolves away to reveal chunks of peanuts to be chewed right at the end. They are meant to be savored slowly. If you've only chewed and swallowed these candies, you've missed a lot."
141,The bottles leaked.<br /><br />10/10/2011  9:10 A.M. Damage reported. / Damage claim under investigation.<br />10/10/2011  9:03 A.M. Transportation accident occurred. / All merchandise discarded. UPS will notify the sender with details of the damage.
142,"Vermicelli rice noodles are always a great addition to soup or stir-fry.  This is my first brown rice vermicelli and it fairly similar to white rice vermicelli.  The main differences were the taste and consistency.  The taste is more flavorful and slightly nutty, like brown rice.  The consistency was less pleasing however.  This whole grain vermicelli feels tougher and denser than it's more processed counterpart, as you would expect if you've had whole wheat pasta.<br /><br />Preparing Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli is exceedingly simple.  The directions on the bag say to soak for 1 minute in cool water.  I like to use salty broth because they will soak up the flavor of the broth.  If you are eating them in soup, you are done and simply add the noodles to the soup; no cooking is needed.  For stir-fry's you'll want to toss them in a hot wok with your sauce or oil for a minute or two.  If you crisp them up, the consistency is less noticeable."
143,Bertolli is the best tasting olive oil. I have tried others and this is best to make olive oil dips and dressings. I use this for all my cooking from sauteing to frying. I even made a great olive oil mayonaise with this. My whole family loves it. Not only does it taste good it is good for you.
144,"Feeding this to my 12 year old cat, she enjoyed the chicken pot pie quite a bit...and went through an entire can in one sitting. (Not sure if this is a good or a bad thing though!) The chinese chicken she ate, but didnt seem thrilled about. Giving a container to two other cat owners produced the same results. So, if I were to buy in the future, which I very well may, I would hope I could buy a carton of the Chicken Pot Pie by itself. But all in all this is quality food, and seemed to sit in my mature cats stomach easily - very important as all pet owners are still very cautious after last years awful pet food poisonings."
145,"These fly traps get 5 stars, except that in our Texas heat they evaporate too quickly. I'm going to try the gallon size and see if that stays effective longer for us. We can't live outdoors without these!!"
146,"One thing is certain, they don't skimp on the blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this drink!  If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim."
147,"I began using Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed several months ago for the added omega and protein.  I had changed my diet, or I would rather call it a lifestyle, and continue to eat mostly steamed veggies and fresh fruits.  I add the hemp seed to my fruit and it is especially good with oatmeal and salads.  It can also be added to baked goods and most anything you are cooking.  I love the nutty texture and flavor it adds to foods.<br /><br />I have tried other brands, but prefer Bob's Red Mill Hulled Hemp Seed.  I have purchased it at health food stores, but found it was so much easier and less expensive to order online.  As recommended it can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer, so I buy a case at a time.<br /><br />Enjoy healthy eating!"
148,"Great product for the busy dog.  Good for their teeth, and they don't swell when wet like rawhide products.  They arrive individually wrapped which seems to keep the  dirt and bugs off."
149,"I ordered because it was supposed to be a variety of 25 different flavors without ordering 25 boxes. However, I only received 20 different flavors not counting the ones that technically are same flavor just a decaf version. I also received 4 of one pod when I thought it could have been a little more diverse. The product did not match the description given and that's what is disappointing. I would have at least like to have been shipped what I thought I was paying for and not ripped off about 5 more flavors to make the most of the variety. With that being said, I do not think I will be ordering from amazon again."
150,"This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid. My kids love it! This brand should serve as an example to the rest of this industry."
151,"I love these canned artichoke hearts.  They are an easy way to add a vegetable to so many different recipes, and they taste great!"
152,"My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.  I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.  Thank you, HappyBaby, for such great products!!"
153,Green Mountain Caribou Blend is by far my favorite coffee and this was a great price on bulk.  I drink it everyday and it is bold and rich.  Highly recommend!!
154,"As everyone else has already said, this is the best hot sauce on the planet!  We always called it ""rooster sauce""...and my first exposure to it was this little bar/restaurant that was local to the college I was attending at the time (quite some time ago...lol).  Anyway, I used to put this sauce on EVERYTHING - pizza, burgers, french fries, marinara-based pastas....even omelettes/scrambled eggs.  But once I graduated and moved, I didn't run across Sriracha chili sauce (the original Huy Fong version, that is) for years.  I stumbled across it recently on an Asian food website and promptly ordered 4 bottles.  I just ordered 6 more today!  And just so you know, the Amazon price for the 6-pack beats anything I've come across thus far (especially considering that it's eligible for free shipping if you spend $25 or more).<br /><br />While I love anything spicy, I suppose that some folks might find this to be a bit much (so if you don't like spicy food, stear clear).  But for those of you who enjoy ""spicy"", this is the ultimate condiment!  I disagree with the reviewer who stated that they don't taste much of a difference between this and Tabasco.  This sauce tastes like chili peppers and garlic.  I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar taste to it.  Plus, Sriracha sauce is THICK - which I like much better, as it stays on food like pizza or french fries.  Tabasco is watery...and isn't as hot as Sriracha.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a great deal - so stock up!  You won't be disappointed!"
155,"This is a good tasty juice. It contains acai berries that are known for the antioxidant abilities. I drink it every morning, it nicely stabilize my metabolism. I like this flavor the most, it's less sour than the original flavor."
156,Excellent!  Very happy with the product.  I am a big tea drinker and definitely love this tea brand.  Will order this classic tea again.
157,"I was fortunate enough to find ""Muir Glen Organic Whole Peeled Tomato with Basil, 28-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"" from Amazon.  Initially, I had bought a couple of cans of this product at a health-food store which is almost a hundred miles away, and not close enough and convenient to drive to when I needed more. I have been making ""Tomato Soup With Basil"" and these tomatoes are excellent to use in the recipe and because they are  ORGANIC makes them safer and healthier for me to use. THANK YOU, Amazon! You are indeed  a ""Friend In Need""!"
158,"reed's specializes in lots of ginger-based products.  you should like ginger if you try their stuff.  i find this drink very tasty.  has lots of stuff in it: ginger, green tea, ginseng, goji, acai, camu camu, jiaoguolan, ltheanine and b vitamins.  25% fruit juice isn't bad considering most drinks have between 5 -10%.  120 calories, carbs is high at 33g.  all-in-all though, i really like the taste.  it's not overbearing in any flavor.  a very refreshing treat on a hot 'n humid day."
159,"I do not like smoked foods (cheese, meats, etc). So, I took a gamble by purchasing this tea because I was looking for new and unique flavors. The description says ""golden black tea with a delicate smokey flavor."" Delicate could not be farther from the truth! This was shipped to me along with 5 more boxes of different Twinings flavors. When I opened the package, all I could smell was this - despite the fact that each bag is sealed in a paper bag, inside a plastic wrapped box! The smoke smell was overwhelming. When I showed it to my husband, he said it smelled like tobacco. The smell was so bad, I could not even brew a cup.<br /><br />Other reviewers obviously enjoyed this, but for me it was a complete waste of money. I could not even give the tea away."
160,"This tomato paste tastes great! I used it in a month after opening (was fine stored in the fridge), for making different pasta dishes. What I like about it is that it is sold in a glass jar unlike many others that use BPA containing metal cans."
161,"My family has always loved Kool-Aid, especially the Black Cherry flavor.  I have been unsuccessful in finding any where we live in Washington.  So I googled the product and flavor and up it came, I ordered the quantity I wanted and now I have it.  Thanks so much.<br /><br />Patti Scrivens"
162,"I have been buying the Starbucks Cafe Verona K-cups at Costco since they came out.  I love them.  I would give them 7 stars if I could.  I found these Sumatra K-cups at Amazon Warehouse and got them for an average of $.65/cup, which I think is fair.  I had never tried the Sumatra, but glad I did because they are very good.  Very bold, very smooth, not so bold it tastes like you're drinking from an ashtray.  Amazing how Starbucks gets their K-cups to taste pretty dang close to the real thing."
163,These are what I would call real ginger snaps. It reminds me of the ginger snaps I grew up with in England. To me the major downfall is that they are only bite-size. I would love a bigger cookie. These are great to dunk in a coffee but beware you cannot eat only one. I just wanted more after each one. Before I knew it the bag was empty. I will be looking for these again.
164,I purchased these little treat balls for my daughter's miniature schnouzer and he learned quickly to treat himself with these. He loves chasing them around too. Keeps him busy and out of trouble.
165,"I can do without a lot of things but I can't function (or be happy!) without my coffee.<br /><br />I like a good,strong (not bitter) cup of coffee. TULLY'S Italian Roast is excellent. If you're looking for a bit of variety, TULLY'S French Roast is also delicious."
166,"Was a little worried this tea wasn't what I was looking for but honestly it has exceeded expectations. If you enjoy a black tea infused with flavors of peach, you will love this tea. I highly recommend as an iced tea; an excellent way to beat the heat."
167,This flavor is the only Crystal Light product I enjoy.<br />It seems to be no-longer available in my area.<br />They have added many more flavors and different packaging but eliminated this flavor from the shelves.<br />This is why I purchased a modestly large quantity (for personal consumption) from Amazon.
168,"This Coffee is just delightful!!<br />I have this coffee delivered every three months, it's great it comes in 3 packs for a wonderful price.<br />I buy 2 sets every 3 months. It's better that way for me, you can just buy 1 3 pack or more.<br />The taste is smooth and rich with no after taste but good tasting coffee.<br />I would rate this Copper Moon Coffee a 10+.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPPXS4"">Copper Moon Kona Blend Medium Roast, Whole Bean Coffee, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a><br />You can buy this Coffee already ground also."
169,Well you probably know exactly what you are getting. Either love them or hate them. They bring fond memories of my childhood. Still tastes the same. Kids love them and the price is right.
170,I've purchased beans from Penzy's and Spice House and these were every bit as good.  Very plump and fresh.
171,"They aren't quite as low carb as some of the other Bold flavors - but they are soooooo delicious...sometimes I forget to care! All of the Bold Flavors I've tried are fantastic. I already have a terrible addiction to crunchy nuts, pecans, macadamias, almonds, brazil...come to mama! (not a huge fan of cashews) But the Bold line of of these Blue Diamond almonds are just outrageously delicious. Drink lots of water, because you'll be eating a lot of these!"
172,"My kids like a peanut butter sandwich for a snack, but their school is ""nut free"". At the beginning of the year, they were willing to eat this Wowbutter, but by the middle of the school year, they were saying it tastes bad. It doesn't really taste like peanut butter; it's kind of a smokey taste. I think the smokiness was overpowering for the kids. It's not bad, so it still gets 3 stars, but I think adults would enjoy this more than kids. Try Sunbutter instead for kids."
173,"I love this product but many of the patties arrived squished and leaky.  Maybe they were place too close to some heat source.  I have ordered the patties before without any problem, however."
174,"What a treat! I've ordered these several times and keep comin' back for more! Organic, cheesy and delicious...great snack."
175,Love this rosemary when I don't have fresh.  This goes so well if you want to marinate in conjunction with extra virgin olive oil and wild caught fish.
176,Just received this candy in the mail today and I an super impressed!! The seller shipped it on the day I ordered it. I am having a lego party for my son and this filled up 25 bags with enough left to decorate cupcakes for his classroom treat. My son is so excited to give them to his friends. We tasted them and they are a little harder then a sweet tart but my 5 and 6 year olds didn't have a problem and they thought they were delicious!! I figured there would be some broken pieces from shipping but I only found 1 broken piece. They are well made and well packaged!!
177,"The Spicy Thai chips used to be the best tasting chips on the market.  However, Kettle Foods has changed the ingredients used, with ginger  being the most important that is now missing.  Notice that they removed ""ginger with attitude"" from the bag.  Sadly, the changing of the ingredients has ruined the chips for me.  They aren't that good anymore and the spice level is virtually non-existent.<br /><br />Here are the original and new ingredient listings:<br /><br />Original Ingredients<br />Select Potatoes, Safflower and/or Sunflower Oil, Honey Powder (Evaporated Cane Syrup, Honey)Salt, Garlic Powder, Jalapeno Pepper, Ground ginger, Onion Powder, Habanero Pepper, Dried Parsley, Citric Acid, Cilantro Extract, Ginger Oil, Cayenne Pepper, White Pepper, Lime Oil.<br /><br />New Ingredients<br />Potatoes, safflower and/or sunflower oil, sugar, dried cane syrup, salt, maltodextrin, yeast extract, spices, garlic powder, onion powder, dried parsley, jalapeno powder, citric acid, natural flavors, lime extract<br /><br />I'm assuming they changed the ingredients in order to cut costs for their new owner,  Blue Diamond.  They might want to get rid of  ""Great Taste Naturally"" from their bags as I don't consider maltodextrin to be very natural.<br /><br />Great job Kettle!  Way to ruin a great thing!"
178,"Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi."
179,"This is very good water, but it is WAY over-priced on here.  I buy this same pack at walmart for $3 dollars (regular-price)!!  Doesn't taste funny to me, but whoever said that might want to look into that, maybe that area got a bad batch!"
180,"Really nice beans here folks, they came moist aromatic and they made some really delicious vanilla.  At 16 a pop you can make a few bottles and give them as gifts, everyone loves a bottle of vanilla as a present."
181,"These shortbread cookies are amazing. They are made of only 4 simple ingredients (wheat flour, butter, sugar, and salt), and they taste heavenly. If you made these cookies yourself, at home, you would use the same ingredients. There is nothing artificial added.<br /><br />Besides all of that, they are crispy, very satisfying and not too sweet. My grandchildren love them as much as I do. If you like shortbread, you will love these cookies. If you haven't tried shortbread cookies, I suggest you give these a try and start with the best, right from the Scottish Highlands."
182,"i love these they are so good. they arrived very fast, and was in great shape, and was delish!!"
183,I love a strong cup of coffee but these are just sooooooo bitter and overly strong for a medium roast.  We had them for Christmas morning and even my inlaws thought they were gross !!
184,"Have used this product for a few years for seasoning roast beef in roaster.  We enjoy the taste.  The stores in our area quit selling this, so I went online.  We bought 16 packs and will buy more if we run out.  Tried other brands, but did not like the taste as well."
185,This is the perfect holiday gift that I gave to my grandparents. It has a variety of flavored teas. The teas are delicious. Definitely recommend this gift for the whole family.
186,"There were a lot of negative reviews but I still bought this anyway. It tasted like the kettle corn you get from the store. The bags are small, but they are 100 calorie packs, they work great for my lunch and when you want a small snack with not all of the fat. You have to be careful not to put on the normal popcorn setting or you will burn it."
187,"I bought these because I imagined they would be like Cola-flavored sour patch kids. Soft, chewy, sour, & delicious. Oh what a dream come true that would have been :)<br /><br />But sadly, thats all it will remain for me. A dream...<br />You see, as soon as I took my first bite I knew I had made a mistake.<br />This gummy is too difficult to chew... In fact, it reminds me of a poorly cooked stake. By the time you swollow a bite all the flavor has been lost...<br /><br />No one likes chewing tough steak, because it's like chewing meat flavored bubble-gum. Only, instead of spitting it out in the end, you swollow it. Well in this case you have a similar issue. Once you're tired of chewing it, you just wanna spit it out. Why bother with the extra calories?<br /><br />What I mean is, halfway through chewing- the flavor & sourness is lost and so is the willpower for me to eat the rest..."
188,"Wonderful hot  chocolat, Very cream. I will recommand this product to all. This is the best coco ever. I enjoy the Nestle Hot Cocoa mix."
189,"This is a regular fast moving product at Sam's Club.  It's everyday price is $7.99 and can be shipped to your home.  The price here is for only one item, not multiples.  Too expensive!!!"
190,"This is a delicious chocolate bar.  But for the additional cost, I was expecting something extra special.  It tastes no better than a standard Hersey bar and has a very slightly rubbery texture."
191,"This coffee is ok for the price.  Better than most supermarket brands.  Similar to Starbuck's House Blend.  I prefer a little richer, darker brew than this, but I think the quality is fine.  No ""off"" flavors that I detected.  I forgot to add that it seems to me to be low acid.  This is a large bag I ordered and I left the whole bag out on the counter and used it from there, but it got a little stale before I used it all.  I would suggest just taking out a bit at a time and storing the balance."
192,This assortment is very well worth the money...you cannot beat the price and the selection is not just a bunch of short tiny pieces...I have ordered this twice and both times the bag was actually OVER the five pounds they advertise...If your dog likes these bully sticks you cannot go wrong ordering this...
193,Good jerky overall. Maybe people earlier got a bad batch. A little salty but not too overwhelming. BBQ flavor tastes good. Jerky is soft and chewy and cut into big pieces. Cant beat the price. 4/5
194,"I LOVE cacao nibs and I so much wanted to love these, as they are a small organic company from Ecuador. I bought these, Navitas and a generic brand, from Peru at my local food store to compare. Compared to the other 2 these were of terrible quality, both in appearance and taste. They look washed out, and don't have the fresh, sort of oily look that the other raw organic cacao nibs I bought had and are much smaller pieces. They are about half the six of others on average and the bag included much of what I would call cacao nib powder. Their taste is less pungent and their texture a bit dry, less cool and crispy than others. The biggest problem with them is that the bag is FULL of shells, which are not chewable, and must be picked out. You cannot eat them in crunchy delicious handfuls at your desk.... or even pour them into a recipe. Actually, you have to meticulously inspect each small group of them for shells, which are hard to tell from these super small nibs. Anyway, for the best quality I would go with Navitas or another brand that you can see in person before you buy. From my experience if they look good they are good! I hope this helps."
195,"This paste is wonderful in so many different foods.  I combine it with lemon and rub it on a roast chicken or baked cut up chicken or on a thanksgiving turkey.  I combine it with chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce and spread it on thinly sliced pork for a few hours then grill it for tacos al pastor along with grilled thinly sliced red onions and sliced grilled pineapple.  I use it as part of the seasonings for the chicken that goes in tamales.  I use it for about a dozen other recipes.  This stuff is amazing and brings life to so many dishes.<br /><br />This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico (according to my Mom) and is widely used in Mexican cooking.  It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use.  It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices.  It is commonly also called Recado Rojo.<br /><br />Once opened, I store the leftover paste in the refrigerator for best results.  That keeps it tasting fresh and helps keep it from drying out."
196,"Our German Shepherd, a spayed female, who is 8 years old, really likes Puperonies. She is very smart--taught her self to lower the rear-door window on our Honda Accord. She did not learn to remove her foot from the switch after the window was lowered. As a r esult of holdng down on the switch, the motor stopped working. She very  much likes the Puperonis."
197,"My daughter calls them mountain drops.  My son calls them sour drops.  They both love the taste, and I even had to stop myself from eating them.  They taste exactly like sour gum drops.  It's hard to believe that they're nutritious."
198,"They are the greatest low-fat, organic snack that I have ever tasted!!!! It taste just like pumpernickel bread from the holidays and I love it! It only haves 1.5 grams of fat for  14 pretzels which is a hearty snack. I can not say enough great things about this snack."
199,"I absolutely love the Oreo Thin Crisps cookies <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WI"">Oreo Thin Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>. They taste great and satisfy my chocoholic craving without compromising my diet."
200,"I really like that this is organic, fair trade, water process decaf coffee- can't ask for much more!<br /><br />I am frankly a bit leary of some of the other types of decaf because they use chemicals in the decaffeination process.<br /><br />This coffee tastes fine to me for a medium roast."
201,"When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you."
202,3 of the flavors are pretty good but the Sweet Potato & Chicken is pretty gross. I was wondering why my daughter didn't want to eat it until I tried it myself
203,we moved our dog to this food when all of the dog food recalls happened. I figured if I wouldn't feed my kid the candy from china why would I feed my dog food that also had ingredients from china.  Not enough restrictions on products that come out of their for people let alone animals. My dog devours this food and is very healthy.
204,This is the most expensive water I've seen. Who are they marketing to...lottery winners only? Nobody should pay this much.
205,It's gift for my princess.It tastes good and  baby love it.Packaging is also very carefully so they arrived home safely.
206,"I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date..."
207,"These raisins were great. They have a long shelf life, taste great, and there weren't any surprise ingredients when I checked the label or the packages."
208,I have bought Organix dog food and these treats for several years because they have no chemicals.  My dogs love them.  They also come in various natural flavors.<br />I have one Samoyed and two Poms and the treats are the prefect size for all.  They can be easily broken in small pieces for small dogs.
209,This is the only place I could find gluten free angel food cake.  Only problem is I didn't realize I needed 12 egg whites.
210,"Given that we are living in a time when (at least in the US) we are told that fats in our diets are bad for us, it is a real pleasure to find an item like this.  I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course)."
211,Paella and rissotto makers breath wasy. This product is grown in America and stands up very well against expensive imports. I love it and buy it in 50 lb bags and store excess in small freezer bags and freeze to protect from bugs.
212,This is the best tea! If you are looking to relax this is the ticket!
213,"The sugar free Pumpkin Pie  syrup is delicious. There is not a strong pumpkin flavor ...it's more of a spice flavor and would be great to drink all year, not just at the Holidays."
214,"I count that as a good thing because my baby doesn't take to sweeter foods.  This flavor concerned me because of the apples and mangos, but they've blended it perfectly with the carrots.  It's tasty, but not sweet.  Love the food combinations with this brand.  Not wild about the packaging, but it is what it is."
215,"This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.<br /><br />And for hot weather, or for the flavors of Larabars that go better with cold beverages, cold iced tea works very well also with Larabars.<br /><br />Oh, and I need to tell you, Larabars are natural - no added sugar, only natural sugar from fruits.  There are no bad ingredients.  There is also no soy.  Larabars are healthy, convenient, filling, perfect.  And vegan.  And even if you aren't vegan, you can still eat Larabars because they are so good.  They are so good, you forget that they are made from healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll Larabar.  Highly Recommended."
216,we have large bbq's and everyone seems to love the sauce... its not just sauce... it has small chunks of good in it
217,This was  a real plesure to grow.  My cats really love it.  The only thing is I have to keep the cats away from it while it grows :><br /><br />You get a generous amount of seeds and you can put it in pots and just water it and you are all set.
218,"These are really tasty; a very good low-cal treat.  The flavors are much more intense than some suckers.  Just one of these is also a great, easy way to get some extra vitamin c into my kid in the winter time especially."
219,"Don't buy this if you love to make every meal from scratch from natural fresh ingredients or if you can't stand McDonald's - I'll just start out by saying that.  Me, I have the eating habits of a 6 year old and rarely introduce something new to my diet, I'm an incredibly picky eater, so I thought this cheesy skillet meal was pretty good.  Definitely give this a try if you're like me, or if you have a kid who only wants mac 'n' cheese and you're going out of your mind trying to get some protein in their diet."
220,"When I first found out that my 4 year old I had to go Gluten free I was a little worried about how she would handle it. GF Bisquick has made it a lot easier. I have been able to make her favorite foods such as chicken fingers, corn dogs, pizza and chinese (sweet and sour chicken)with this mix. Pancakes are also a big hit in our house. They have quick and easy recipes on the box. For the chinese- I take their chicken finger recipe and cute the pieces of chicken into bite size pieces, and bake according to the recipe. Cook up some rice and just use a GF sweet and sour sauce a quick simple easy meal that tastes wonderful!"
221,These snacks are just the right amount to give you that sweet and crunchy fix.  The chocolate is just the right amount for me as I am not a total chocoholic.  I really like carmel corn and this was just the right thing to give me the treat of having it but only eating 130 calories.  Great snack.
222,"I love the smell when I open one of these foil pouches - whatever one thinks of the coffee, they have packed a great smell in every bag.<br /><br />As for the coffee, I normally like dark roasts. I expected this to be a medium roast, good for variety, but it's really a very light roast. There are some nice berry notes in the bean, but the coffee flavor is just too weak.<br /><br />It also brews up too weak. I don't know if there is too little coffee in the bod, or if the pouch material isn't as effective as others - but something's not quite right here.<br /><br />So: 4 stars for fragrance and berry notes, 2 stars for the pouch material, 3 stars if you like mild roasts."
223,"The plants were exactly like the one pictured.  Each pot came with 3 stalks.  They arrived in good shape. While a bit pricey, they were quite full.  Shipping was reasonable, but that's because we ordered multiple plants, which cuts the shipping cost per plant significantly.<br /><br />They are planted in a potting mix that is a bit strange compared to what we usually see here in California. Looks like ground peat moss, but I can't say for sure. After watering the plants, they seem to dry out quickly, but we've had some rather hot weather here lately.  Maybe not peat moss.  We plan to move them into another pot with potting mix from around here.<br /><br />We have noticed a number of dropped leaves since they arrived. (2 weeks)  We know how to manage Aralias as we have over 10 currently around our house. (Ming, Fabian, False, and Parsley) So I'm not sure if it's just a change in location/climate or something else.<br /><br />These Parsley Aralias look somewhat different than the ones we bought about 8 years ago here in California. The leaves seem thicker and the plant is fuller. (Dense foliage) I'm not sure if it's due to different conditions/climate or fertilization, but they are not as light and airy looking as what we're used to.  We'll see over time if they change or stay the same.<br /><br />Overall.....a good purchase."
224,"Pretty close to the taste of a freshly opened coconut.  I'd like to know more about the process for obtaining this water to understand what the ""natural coconut water"" means.  The tasty juicy bits of pulp in the product add an extra complexity and make this a very refreshing beverage.  The fresh coconut is jelly like and not so pulpy, but it's still tasty."
225,"I am a fan of these cookies and order frequently.  This was the first time that I had broken cookies,  They were still delicious but several were all crumbs. I compained in packaging feedback as well but it was the inside box that smashed the cookies. Only gave three stars due to breakage.  These are five star cookies!"
226,"I have tried numerous protein bars and all have that lovely aftertaste like I just ate cardboard covered in multivitamins....but not this one!!  This one is absolutley wonderful.  I am a hairdresser and there are a lot of days where I dont eat at all because I am booked back to back, so I have been looking for not only something that tastes good but will be relativley healthy and keep the hunger pains away and I have forund all of the above with these bars!  Again, I love them....just saying."
227,"For some reason, these are nearly twice the price locally.  My dog likes these and his teeth/gums seem cleaner, but I don't know how to quantify that.  The foil bag inside the cardboard container is reclosable which helps a great deal with freshness."
228,"""Legend has it that in his endeavor to cope with all his wives a certain Sultan summoned all his confectionery experts and ordered them to produce a unique dessert to add to his collection of secret recipes for which he was famous. As a result of extensive research Turkish Delight was born.""<br /><br />The ingredients are as basic as sugar, water and starch, but the flavor is smooth, slightly soft and sticky and dreamy floral sweet. It is impossible to imagine how such perfection evolves from the list of ingredients. The Turkish Delights in this beautifully designed box are flavored with lemon or rose.<br /><br />The rose flavor is especially exotic and transports you to lands of mystery and intrigue. My husband usually eats the lemon ones. The beautiful box and the sweet delicious confections make this an excellent gift for anyone you want to spoil. I usually buy just one box but if you add a small item you can have four boxes with no shipping charges. What a deal!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
229,"This is strictly a product of convenience, for it tastes about as you might expect (or perhaps worse) of something in styrofoam from a microwave.  I wasn't expecting a gourmet experience, but on the other hand I wasn't expecting chicken soup that tastes like some high school chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong.  A much better solution would be to buy yourself a ream of styrofoam cups and a dozen cans of Campbell's cream of chicken soup.  If you can afford the 30 seconds with a can opener and a spoon, you'll be rewarded with something that provides a reasonable facsimile of the taste of real soup."
230,"This tea has a fresh peach flavor, not artificial-tasting like some others I have tried. It has a natural sweetness, and is refreshing served either hot or iced."
231,"If you have not had the pleasure of tasting this delightful, crisp, cracker, I would highly recommend it. And, a warning, if you try it with peanut butter, you WILL BECOME ADDiCTED!"
232,"I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.<br /><br />According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues."" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.<br /><br />For me the evidence is clear - this is good quality food, my dog loves it and I love that when I buy Newman's Own products, the royalties go to charity!"
233,"I first tasted this at Petrossian.  I had ordered Green Tea and when I tasted it, I was a little shocked that it was not regular green tea.  I noticed the citron immediately and it was fantastic.  It complimented the tea very well.  The tea is very light.  Au Bon Pain also carries this tea.  Try it out!"
234,This is an awesomely soft cookie. I loved this cookie it was really one of the best things I have ever tasted.
235,My five year old yellow lab loves these health bars. She gets a whole bar after a long walk or they are easy to break up for smaller treats. I love all the healthy ingredients. Thanks Harmony Farms.
236,"15 bottles for 30 dollars?<br /><br />CVS, Shoprite, Pathmark, and Stop and Shop all sell it for less. A LOT less.<br /><br />In fact, There is a sale at shoprite now, 10 for 8 dollars. Which is less than half of the price this seller is asking for.<br /><br />Why on Earth is it 2 dollars a bottle? Is this a special version of Vitamin Water Zero or something? Does it do magic? Will it give me sexual pleasure?<br /><br />ROFL at the price."
237,"If you like chocolate and coffee, this one is a perfect choice. The flavor is great and not too strong for someone who enjoys a light roast coffee. When it's available it goes fast as it seems to be a favorite. Van Houtte has my favorite flavored coffees. Give this one a try and see what you think!"
238,Good low sodium low sugar granola that I feel I can't afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues.
239,"This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.<br />Its velvety smooth and absolutely perfect around the holidays. (although we drink it year 'round.) Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!  Get some and you will see exactly what I mean."
240,"I was glad to find this high-protein low-carb dry cat food here on Amazon.  It is conspicuously absent from the shelves of many big box pet food stores.  maybe some mom-and-pop's carry this brand.  I have some finicky eaters who have their days when they decide they don't want to eat the homemade Food.  It is likely due to years of eating popular brand foods with high carb content,  mostly corn.  no doubt it can taste yummy but it's the same prescription for fattening livestock before the slaughter.  not exactly the goals I have for my cats.  they are made to have a high protein diet.  when was the last time you saw a wildcat chewing down on some corn?  by going to high  protein  I have noticed  am marked increase in my cats activity level.  also  their litter boxes smell much better.  high-protein wet food is the best day to day choice for my pets.  Evo makes a great supplement.  I can add some  to the wet food on those finicky days  without compromising on quality.  Evo can even be used  as a fun treat.  I recommend it,  and  my cats love it."
241,"Started using Coffeemate powder in college and a couple<br />decades later STILL find it to be THE BEST in our coffee! Outside<br />of real rich cream (which is too fattening and only as a treat<br />and anytime we travel on holiday)we have always come back to Coffee Mate<br />and thats all we ever buy now.....about the dissolving, we've never had any<br />problems with it...it's delicious!  And best in bigger containers too!"
242,"this brand has always amazed people with their coffee flavors, and the vermont country blend is just one of them, my husband and i tried it for the 1st time and we loved it...."
243,"The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in."
244,"I received this trial coffee pod and the bonus was the organic part of this product.  I heated up a 10 oz of hot water and placed this pod in the hot water.  After simmering about 5 min., I would enjoy my organic cup of coffee.  This might be stronger if I had a pod like coffee machine but I didn't want to have another appliance in my house.  Overall, if I had a pod machine, I would purchase this product.  Of course, I liked that this product was fair trade and grown without pesticides."
245,"We purchased this and opened it within three days of getting it. The popped product was very tasteless with small  kernels and very large hulls. There weren't a lot of 'old maids' so we didn't believe the product was stale as much as it was just inferior corn. We purchased a jar of Orville and popped it the same evening and there was much more flavor and the kernels were larger with less hull. So in the compost went the Paragon product, not to be purchased again. In this instance we feel we got what we paid for."
246,I ordered Esbilac 2nd step to supplement my (6) puppies feeding and to begin the weaning process off the mother.  The pups enjoyed the Esbilac.  It was easy to prepare (I used water) and I could warm it easily.
247,"I used to order Eden's from Amazon Subscribe and Save when they had smaller cans, 15 OZ I believe. They got rid of those and after a while of not being able to order anything we can now purchase these 29 OZ cans on subscribe and save. The beans are still great and the cans are BPA free but there is just too much in one can. The beans go bad if you don't use them within a week or so. I like my beans but I don't like to eat 29 OZ in a week! I will not purchase these again unless I figure out a way to preserve them."
248,"I bought these b/c I felt a sinus infection creeping up on me...spring allergies are wreaking havoc once again. I love drinking anise tea so I saw these ""Jakemans Throat and Chest"" lozenges, anise flavored, and wanted to give them a try. They are deliciously smooth and have helped soothe my sore throat and another great side effect, they have really helped clear my sinus passages too. Great little lozenges, I will keep these in my medicine cabinet for sure."
249,"I really appreciate that this is available in a large size. I hate wasting all the little plastic bags of single-serving size packages. The dried pineapple is really delicious and organic. Some of the chunks get a little brown, but I tend to like those more because they are more moist. I will certainly buy this again."
250,These are my favorite chips.  Very crunchy and tasty.  Not processed and mealy like other baked chips.  You'd never know you were eating a reduced fat product.  The best!!!
251,"I just got a new puppy (chihuahua) and at 7 1/2 weeks, I gave him one. After that one, he wanted more. Although he is really tiny at just over 2.1 lbs, he had no problems eating a whole one, although I usually break it in 1/2. They are ideal for small dogs and puppies."
252,"My service dog loves this food and never leaves his bowl without finishing it! and I love that I can get it on amazon for about 10$ LESS than at petco or petsmart(& save gas and my BACK having it delivered)! if you care about your dog you will spend a little more, because then you don't have to feed them as much because they get their nutrients with WELLNESS! I just wish I could use my coupons on amazon!"
253,My son brought these home one day for our 12 year old Cocker Spaniel. She became 'hooked' on them rather quickly and starts howling for them around 7:00pm daily. Amazon pricing is significantly less than the local stores and Prime delivery is incredibly convenient.
254,I have tried other mild brews but this is the best by far it meets all of my requirements for this type of coffee.
255,"I recently bought an espresso maker  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002A3S66"">De'Longhi BAR32 Retro 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>  which I love, and wanted some good coffee to go with it.  Originally I was going to buy the illy espresso, but I saw this and it's cheaper and got great reviews, which are definitely well-deserved.  It's so delicious and I love the smell of the coffee - it's chocolaty.  MMMmmmmmmm."
256,A drop at a time in a bowl (or pot) of chili will give you the heat level you want. I will save a lot of money on peppers for my chili. A little on a toothpick brought a fellow heat lover to tears.
257,"I'm a candy addict.  This has provided a good replacement for all the sugar I was taking in.  Good flavor, no bad after taste.  I did not experience any discomfort from excessive consumption either."
258,This item is difficult to find in my area of western North Carolina.  I was pleased to see it available here.  The product is a great snack loaded with fiber and nutrition.
259,"My daughter has food allergies and it is hard to find a bar that she can eat.  These are great tasting and healthy.  I know she will eat the KIND PLUS, Almond Cashew.  The whole family enjoys them."
260,"Mighty Leaf Tea pouches are near whole leaf tea in a handsewn pouch. As easy to use as Lipton tea bags, but far more delicious. Green tea offers anti-oxidant benefits, and the leafs are distinguishable as such, rather than crumbled powder in more conventional American tea bags. Mighty Leaf Organic Hojicha is flavorful, full-bodied, light colored tea. It's good for you, good for the environment."
261,"I found this dog food after doing research to help my dogs allergies (2 goldens).<br /><br />My dog had terrible allergies,  she has been on Canidae all life stages for about 5 weeks now.<br /><br />No more itching, scratching, ear infections and vomiting. Their fur is silky & they are so happy & healthy.<br /><br />Use the food cost calculator. your dog eats less of this than many of the garbage filled brands. They also offer coupons on their web site. It really isn't that expensive.<br /><br />If you have cats we have switched ours to the felidae and can also highly recommend it."
262,I bought this because so many people in their reviews had said this did not have a bitter after taste like so many other stevia sweeteners.<br />Well it does!<br />It has a terrible bitter taste.
263,My 5 months old dog used to love this food. For some reason he doesn't like it anymore. It has very good ingredients. I wish he would eat it because I know it's good for him.
264,I purchase this product for the office. The clients like it and it is not too over-powering. I appreciate the savings through Subscribe & Save!
265,This is the best cheese topping in the world! Great for putting on your popcorn and your favorite pasta dish. It has become nearly impossible to find this cheese topping in supermarkets. Thank goodness we have Amazon.com.
266,"Ordered these for a bowling party & they are very cute. The party is this weekend, so I am really excited! I have no idea how they taste, but they look GREAT! :-)"
267,"I was originally hesitant to try these given the mixed reviews. I really love buckwheat and use it in a variety of different ways including as a hot morning cereal, fresh ground for homemade bread and  pancakes (nothing beats fresh ground buckwheat flour made into pancakes with 100 wholesome maple syrup) and even in a type of pilaf. After re-reading a few things it appears there are some misconceptions about this product...<br /><br />1. - This is indeed raw and whole grain groats. If you are searching for roasted/toasted buckwheat you need to keep searching. If you are searching for partially ground, flaked, rolled, etc you also need to keep looking. For those that are familiar with Kasha - this is not roasted nor partially broken...when cooked it will turn into little round balls rather like tapioca.<br /><br />2. Not mushy...try this a few times to get the cooking correct. I eat this for breakfast with a little honey several times  per week and it is excellent. No gluten, lots of nutrition including most essential amino acids, very little fat/calories...it's nearly the perfect food. Bring the water to a boil, put in the groats, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for a few minutes. Keep an eye on it - the buckwheat will ""puff"" and become soft. After a few attempts you will learn to recognize the preferred consistency that suites you best.<br /><br />3. Superb nutrition & versatile. Buckwheat should be considered a super-food it's so nutritious without all the other garbage. It's also incredibly versatile - from a hot breakfast cereal (boil and use a touch of honey) to fresh ground for bread (bread makers, use about 1:4 ratio with fresh ground whole wheat...since this has no gluten the wheat will allow it to rise while the buckwheat adds essential nutrients the wheat lacks. For those with a gluten intolerance, buckwheat is a superb alternative and can be used to create bread without any gluten but you will need to use an enhancer to help it rise."
268,"This is a nice, soothing tea when it's hot, but it's even better when brewed over a large plastic cup filled with ice.  Add some sugar, and you've got a minty refreshing drink that really hits the spot on hot days.  I'm definitely getting the 50 count next time around."
269,"To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor."
270,I make protein shakes that require Matcha tea as one of their ingredients..it's pricey<br />but this tea is nicely packed in a storage tin and well priced too.
271,"This is a staple in my house at all times. I use it as a meal replacement since i try to eat 4-5 small meals a day at about 250 calories, which is what Orgain has. It also has an antioxidant berry blend and a greens blend mixed in which is unlike any other protein drink. But the best part is it tastes like chocolate milk and i always want to drink it. AMAZING!! Chocolate fudge is the best flavor by the way. No need to even go to the vanilla or mocha since the chocolate is so delish!"
272,"At any price this is an outstanding, smooth, wonderfully rosted coffee, without the bitter, or burnt overtones of some coffees.  One of the best coffees out there (and I drink six to 8 cups a day and have tried LOTS of different coffees)."
273,"I would like to share with you who are contemplating Mr. Trivedi's products, I was diagnosed with are rare form of acid reflux. I was advised not to drink anything carbonated and a whole list of no no,s.  About 3 months ago I found out about this incredible water, since then that is all I drink.  I had the most amazing results, not only easing my acid reflux,but also drinking the water brings a sense of calmness and almost at the same time a felling of complete happiness and tolerance of which I am not especially noted for.  At the 11-11-11 retreat one of the wonderful staff members remembered me from the center in Soho, she remarked how different and calmer I was compared to 2 months ago. I know there will always be skeptics, I am ready for them.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Trivedi"
274,"When I became gluten sensitive, I most missed baking from scratch. These are great; my friends can't tell the difference. Also try the blonde brownies. Of all the Namaste mixes, both brownies freeze very well when cut in small bite size cubes for when you want a little cheat eat ! Or they can be frozen in a good size square if you are young enough to not fret over the calories in a larger portion."
275,These shortbread cookies are little drops of heaven.  Have you ever noticed that smaller food seems to taste better?  One pouch is one carb and very satisfying.  No meaasuring is always good too.
276,These are by far the most addictive sunflower seeds in the history of mankind.  I can't get enough of these things...seriously!
277,This is the KIND bar that made me look into all the varieties I could find. It's healthful and delicious and not too sweet. It's a chocoholic's dream
278,"Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal doesn't come packaged as a kids' breakfast item, but it sure was a hit with the under-10 crowd in my house.  One bowl revealed the reason why:  it bears a striking resemblance to Frosted Flakes.  The crunchy nut aspect of the cereal comes from tiny nut bits on the flakes themselves, not from any sort of separate clusters.  For that reason, their appearance is actually hit-or-miss from bite to bite.  However, that sweetness is in every spoonful, and if you're not searching for a lot of that flavor, then this may not be the cereal for you.  It's strange to me that the box gives the impression of a wholesome, possibly even healthy cereal and yet the taste is pure kids' Saturday morning treat."
279,I had a storage tower that held 24 capsules and a storage rack that held<br />several boxes of coffee capsules.  Then I saw this device and decided<br />that it was the best alternative because I could stack my Bunn coffee maker<br />and my Keurig coffee maker on top of the storage drawers and not lose counter<br />space.  Works absolutely great.  Wish I had seen this first and saved the<br />money I spent for the other devices.
280,"These are OK for British Tea Biscuits. The kind your Auntie Maude eats at 4pm with her cup of tea. Not too sweet. Not too much fruit. Not much taste or texture. Nothing to over stimulate or even partially stimulate the senses. Just something to eat mindlessly to curb a small appetite until dinner.<br /><br />I really wouldn't call these cookies, or at least not red-blooded, proud-to-be-an-American cookies. They are certainly not French or Italian or even Greek cookies, either. Newtons Fruit Thins are the wan, oat-y things you get served on a small plate in a London tea room right before the check comes. I have nothing against the UK, but other than Scottish shortbread, I can take or leave their ""sweet biscuits"".<br /><br />Now, these Newtons Fruit Thins are not particularly bad for you. In fact they have some whole grain flour added to the enriched, unbleached wheat and rice flours. There is soy lecithin for protein. The mild flavoring comes from bits of figs, raisins, honey, sugar and a tiny, tiny bit of cinnamon. Three of them are 130 calories. I got bored at two.<br /><br />In the classic 1963 movie comedy ""Come Blow Your Horn"", the aging playboy played by Frank Sinatra warns his mooching younger brother to ""Stay away from my Fig Newtons!""<br /><br />Fig Newtons! Now that's a cookie I can get excited about!"
281,This is a WONDERFUL mocha sauce. I purchase for my lattes but my daughter adds it to her hot chocolate...
282,This product was very easy to prepare; and it tasted very much like a quality chocolate cake.  I was very happy with it.
283,Awesome flavors!  I would definately grab the butt rub and put it on some big ole pork again.  I love that it's not so salty.
284,"Oddly this trap is catching all flies...no yellow jackets. I know they are around..is the bait the same as the fly catchers?<br /><br />So, like my review of the fly catchers-this trap will STINK from feet away when half full like feces so you wont want it around sitting/food areas like patios. We love that they are disposable but DOUBLE BAG it first or your trash can will reak. Even when they catch bees, traps do smell badly. So we expected this. Why we switched to disposable vs re-use.<br /><br />Easy to use, good price. They dont catch the good bees like Bumbles."
285,Jet Fuel is our favorite of all the Coffee People dark roasts.  Bold but not bitter.  Great way to start the morning!
286,"I'm always careful what I eat or drink, since I have food allergies.  I'm also allergic to chemicals.  I bought a bottle of this as part of my nutrition regimen.  As soon as I took the first sip, I had to stop drinking.  It left me with the metallic taste everybody's talking about.  My mouth immediately felt very dry and my lips and inside of the mouth started to swell up.  I wasted my money.  Will never buy again."
287,"Love this! I use it on french toast, pancakes, waffles, and some cereals. I also use it in my tea and smoothies. However, I have not baked with it yet. I could say I would be sad and lost without it. BTW...My kids love it too."
288,"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!"
289,My dogs love this product.  It is a fine heathy treat which I give them as a reward.  It's also easy to break so that little dogs can enjoy them as well.
290,These syrups are so versitle that you can use them in desserts dishes and teas and coffees. Thanks so much!
291,I bought this for my daughter and she was very excited to taste it but was very disappointed to find it to be INSTANT cappuccino. It tasted watered down even at the suggested cup setting. We honestly could have got a container of this same stuff at the local dollar store for a lot cheaper and then we could have added more of the powder when needed. Definitely not worth the money.
292,I'm in HOG HEAVEN now. I can cook all kinds of really delicious stuff now using Bisquick. I've never been this happy in a long time! Great product... Great price... Packed up real nice for shipping. I couldn't be any happier. The website listed on the package leads me to many recipes that I can make using Bisquick.
293,My dog loves chewing on the wishbone.  The product was what I expected and the shipping was quick!
294,I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.  I have two dogs that both need daily medications and they also get vitamins.  It was always a battle to get them to take either and had to revert to the shove down the throat and blow on the nose tactic.  That is until now.  Put a little of this stuff on whatever they need to take and wham gone down the throat.  It took about a week and then I stopped using it and the dogs now take their pills without any treatment.  Highly recommend and made my life a little easier.
295,"I've tried numerous coconut oils and I must say I really like this one.<br />It smells so delicious when you open the jar.<br />I enjoy it so much I usually eat 2 Tbsp a day like some people eat peanut butter. If your way of eating is low carbing this product fits the bill and it's so healthy . I also enjoy making a ""candy"" treat with it.<br /><br />1 Tbsp chopped nuts i.e. walnuts, almonds or pecans in a small cupcake paper or aluminum baking cup.  Add 2 tbsp of melted coconut oil  on top of the chopped nuts.<br />Sprinkle 1 tsp of coconut flakes on top.<br />Let it harden in the fridge then it's ready to enjoy.<br />Add a cherry on top when in season, grated orange rinds, strawberry halved...<br />Use your imagination...<br />~Enjoy, Sooo Goood<br /><br />Update: 8/7/2012<br />Don't remember how many times I've ordered this coconut oil but today's another time.<br />Recently, I saw a recipe for Paleo Coleslaw. If you need a change in taste from coleslaw made with mayonnaise then try this one. I really like it because it seems to taste like Asian Coleslaw, sadly, my better half doesn't like it. I even have it with breakfast sometimes.<br /><br />Paleo Coconut Coleslaw<br /><br />This recipe comes from grassfedgirl.com<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />½ head organic red cabbage<br />½ head organic green cabbage<br />1 medium carrot<br />1/2 cup organic apple cider vinegar<br />1/2 cup melted Virgin Coconut Oil<br />2-4 packets Stevia or 2 T raw honey<br />1 tsp celery seed<br />1 sea salt and pepper to taste"
296,"The peanut butter and honey ones are like a candy bar, as state previously.  I can't resist them sometimes when I'm not even working out.  They're delicious.<br />Plus, the company is a really great, which is a bonus.<br />AND I can pronounce and recognize all the ingredients on the back of the bar.<br />Not the most carbs, not the most protein, but it's a good all around training bar....<br /><br />...or a delicious afternoon snack!"
297,"My kids have been asking for some quick fix mac 'n cheese, and I bought this.  The kids have been eating it, but they say that there is a slightly weird aftertaste.  When prepared following the directions, the noodles sometimes aren't quite cooked, and the water ratio isn't quite right --- sometimes ending up with inadequate water to make the sauce. Perhaps that's my microwave, but I haven't noticed this problem with other foods.  The powder sauce packet doesn't mix well even with the hot bits of water, leaving clumps.  The pluses --- quick to make, kids will eat it (sometimes), portions are small -- perfect for a preschooler, requires no milk or added oil.  We are satisfied for the amount we paid, but not likely to purchase again, unless there is a promotion or sale."
298,"I used this product for many years. I favored Imagine for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. The chocolate flavor of this drink is terrific- sweet and chocolaty, totally delicious, and I drank this every day for decades.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as sugar) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants.

299,All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us.
300,It's really stronge but if you combine it with the right foods it taste excellent.. Don't laugh I've found it taste very good with rice..
301,"This was my first purchase of any kind of green superfood drink. It doesn't taste great without fruits or juice. I purchased the green tea energy flavor from Amazing grass and it tasted better with or without juices or fruits. The two orders i placed from one of the amazon sellers, had an expiration date of 2 months from the date i received it... I placed my next order directly from Amazing grass and the expiration date was over a year."
302,"My wife used to drink this coffee, but now we both agree that Coffee People's Kona Blend is the right coffee for both of us."
303,This is an excellent green tea. I enjoy this brand and one from Biglow.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea to anyone who likes green tea. And it is organic for those of you who are into that stuff.
304,"I had high hopes for this wine kit, but after fermenting, bottling and aging for several months, I'm left with 30 bottles of sour wine.  I think this may have been a sanitation issue on my part.  Had the wine not turned sour, I think it would have been pretty good (from a pre-fermentation taste).  I may try this one again in the future.  One thing that I did like about this kit was that it included labels and heat shrink / foil wrappers for the tops of the bottles."
305,I ordered this product assuming that I would recieve what was pictured. What I got was a generic package with a generic label. The tea bags had the paper tag found on teabag strings all torn off. So I really have no idea what kind of tea product I recieved.
306,This cocoa is extremely hard to find and it's my mom's favorite.  I am so excited to be able to subscribe to a monthly delivery for her.  What a super idea!!!
307,These are the best candy bars EVER!  Why don't they have something similar here in the U.S.??  They are light and low in calories compared to other candy bars in the U.S.!  Yumm!!
308,"TIGER SAUCE IS THE BEST HOT SAUCE YOU CAN BUY IN THE USA!  (NO, I'M NOT YELLING.  This isn't yelling.  Am I yelling?  Why are you starting a fight with me?  I'm not YELLING.  This is ""discussing.""  Yeah, fine, go back to your mama.  See if I care.)"
309,"If Goldilocks were sampling popcorn, most are too boring, a few are a little too spicy, but Orville's Salt and Cracked Pepper popcorn has just the right amount of zing.  The mini bags are the right amount of popcorn for one person.  The price is good, and Amazon delivered it even sooner than I had expected.  Check it out."
310,"I was looking forward to this tea, but unfortunately the mint overpowers the hibiscus and essentially makes this just another kind of mint tea.  I prefer the hibiscus tart be the star of the show in a hibiscus-based tea (aka ""herbal infusion"") and in my opinion, mint and ""tropical"" don't mix and now know going forward to pay more attention to the ingredients.  Still worth 3 stars because it can be a refreshing tea on a hot day, but just not a great tropical/hibiscus tea."
311,"Same Splenda taste, but more than just aspartame. Fiber is dissolved well and has quite and effect (at least you know it works). Best fiber additive and sugar replacement found yet, just be sure to mix well in enough liquid or the powder may become slightly viscous, this only happens in very small amounts though. Otherwise excellent product."
312,"I was hesitant about ordering this the first time, but was surprised at how good it tastes. It has a true black tea flavor with just the right amount of lemon. I used it up quickly and have reordered it. Occasionally, I add a little sweetener but most people probably wouldn't feel the need to do so."
313,"These potato chips are excellent.There are no trans fats.<br /><br />They taste absolutely delicious.Whenever I am in the mood for potatoe chips, Kettles is the brand I buy.<br /><br />A great product that anyone should enjoy and I highly recommend them!<br /><br />Enjoy!"
314,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 3:35 Mins<br /><br /></span>When I first reviewed this, I gave it four stars (I'm a hesitant five-star giver), but having now used it for two weeks, it gets the fully approved 5-star love."
315,"I was a little skeptical at first but this honey got rid of a chronic skin rash that plagued me for months.It took about 2 weeks for it to completely disappear and when it flares up now I put the honey on it immediately and it usually prevents it from spreading. It's a little sticky but I rub it in as much as possible. After trying steroid creams and every thing else under the sun, I could not believe that manuka honey could solve this problem. Fantastic!"
316,"I enjoyed this product.  I am trying to use more gluten-free products when ever I can.  I had made this with Gluten-free flour, water, italian seasoning, salt.  Which I then dropped onto a greased cookie sheet - I spread the drops out (thinned them out) cooked them at 425^ for approx 10 or so min, flipped them, cooked them a few min longer - it made like a cracker.  My husband even enjoyed them.<br />From the other reviews - I did notice the ""flavor"" that was mentioned, but if you add spices or seasonings then it is not noticeable."
317,"Received the rectangular box quickly. The plant was about 6"" tall. Nice green stem. Leaves look burned or black. Portion of stem appears to have suffered a small fracture. I chopped it all off. Re-planted in a larger pot and now I have a 3"" green stem. I don't know, time will tell. I wasn't expecting much for the price. It's worth a shot."
318,I tried this wine once on a whim for something different. I've always been more a fan of red wine in general and the traditional Lambrusco red is a staple at our house...but I fell in love with this the first time I sipped it...it is slightly sweet but not overpoweringly sweet...goes wondeful with just about anything. If you like Lambrusco red you should definately try White Lambrusco.
319,"The presence of cinnamon makes the chips softer and kind of soggy. The taste is good and cinnamon is good addition, but I perfer the crisp non-cinnamon version."
320,My cats love the food. The food is formed in the shape of the pouch so I do chop it up with fork to make it easier for them. The food looks and smells like fish. They like the snapper the best. Not to much moisture that had one cat throw up. No more wasted food. They eat it all. I wish it came all snapper but they probably like variety.  Price beats local stores. I buy the auto. delivery method and it saves even more. With auto ship the following deliveries come USPS.  They do notify of up coming shipmnt and you can postpone if need be. You can also get an early one.
321,"I love this bar and eat it every day, it's very healthy and  tastes great but it's priced twice as much what I paid at local supermarket."
322,"It is so frustrating for me looking for real lemon curd. This stuff actually has a good smell to it but it is the same gelatinous mush that I see time and time again; it is not creamy at all. I read another review saying how a little goes a long way, that is a red flag. Real lemon curd is creamy and doesn't go a long way because it is fluffier."
323,"I tried this water and it tasted just ""normal"" to me. Not silky or special or anything.<br /><br />I gave my cats two bowls of water, each with 16 oz of water, one the Essentia and one of just tap water. I saw them drink out of both bowls and water disappeared from both bowls at the same rate.<br /><br />I looked up the pH of my local tap water and it tests between 6.7 and 9.7 pH with an average of 8.6, not so different from this bottle of water but a heck of a lot cheaper.<br /><br />It really seems to me like somewhere around the early 1990s we were all duped into buying bottled water. Some water isn't safe to drink and so it's good that we can get bottled water at times, but it somehow became a status symbol and then a necessity. Now people are either realizing maybe it's dumb to buy bottled water when the bottled water industry isn't even as well regulated as tap water, or moving on to other beverages as ""plain"" water is starting to seem a little boring, so what do the people who sell water do to sell more product? They make it fancier, with caffeine or gathered in glacial melt and harvested from the deep sea, or, it seems, with a high pH.<br /><br />There are all kinds of health claims made about high pH water, but as far as I know there aren't any reputable, scientific studies that back up any of the claims. If there were, I'm sure Essentia would be shouting those claims from the rooftops to sell their product.<br /><br />If you really believe you need water with a pH of 9.5, maybe research what the tap water in your area already is, and if it's not high enough for you there are many options for water ionizers you can purchase in all price ranges."
324,"I can have this shipped to my door cheaper than I can buy it in any store, can't beat that!"
325,"I really like these ""suet peanut balls"", as I call them.  The birds love them too!. I have to tell you though, if you have squirrels, you will certainly want to invest in the ""Squirrel Buster"" feeder (see link below).  I used to use a ""regular"" metal cylinder feeder (like shown on the bag of this item) for the ""suet peanut balls"", but somehow or the other, the squirrels could still get them out of the feeder!  It used to drive me crazy!  I have another Squirrel Buster seed feeder that I really love, and when I saw that they had a new ""suet peanut ball"" feeder, I just had to try it. . .and. . . it works!  I live in downtown Atlanta, and woodpeckers, catbirds, finches and other assorted birds all love these ""suet peanut balls"". . .  and don't worry. . . they don't melt either.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0061O2O8K"">Squirrel Buster Peanut Plus Wild Bird Feeder</a>"
326,"Saw this is the local market, figured for $7 I could get a 12 pack and give these an inexpensive trial.  I just threw away the 9 we didn't use.  for $7 I could have bought 2 boxes of hot chocolate packets and happily boiled the water.  did I even have to give it one star...?"
327,"I tried Crunchy Nut about a year ago when I was visiting the UK. It was absolutely one of the best cereals I had ever had. When I saw it on Amazon, I had to try it to see if it was as good as it remembered. It is!<br /><br />The brand I tried when I was in the UK was more like corn flakes and this one is more like cheerios. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not as sweet as I remember from the flakes brand. I liked the crunch this cereal had and it never got soggy in the six or so minutes it took me to eat a bowl.<br /><br />At 100 calories for 3/4 of a cup, it would seem this cereal delivers taste as well as not hiking up you calorie intake for the day. Now I am no nutritionist so I would advise looking up all its ingredients for things that may not agree with everyone.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this cereal and would not hesitate to get myself another box."
328,"This tastes much better than the ""warm milk"" you get from the various coffee houses like Starbucks."
329,"In my opinion, this is the perfect flavor combination.  It's a great ""sweet treat"" and I would definitely buy this item again."
330,"This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it."
331,"These peppercorns were visibly of much better quality than we'd gotten other places before, and the aroma was tantalizing before we even opened the package!  They arrived fresher than I've ever tasted peppercorns in my life, and the seller is very professional and quick with shipment.  Highly recommended!"
332,I love green mountain coffee! I've tried other hazelnut k-cups and this is by far my favorite hazelnut coffee for my keurig.
333,"The roast was very good, however I would prefer if it did<br />not come seasoned.  It was very good though."
334,"These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it."
335,"This was pretty good, I had to add abit more broccoli and very well seasoned chicken as well as tad bit more cheese....It was ok I have had better but its fine for the occassional quick meal."
336,"We received the Gerber veggies quickly, on time, and in great condition! And my son LOVES this stuff - the consistency is perfect, it is nutritious, and it tastes great!"
337,"It holds the beans.  It's sturdy.  It's well constructed.  It's also undersized, and it crushes the beans."
338,"This tea is excellent. I've tried the zen in black, and  the jade tea, and both are absolutely delicious. The pods can be used the traditional way....you don't need the special brewer. Just get our your tea kettle and your favorite tea cup, and voila!"
339,"I am always searching for low sodium bbq for the family and my in laws are raving about this one!  Easy to prepare and just the right flavor for adding zest to a dinner.  So good , it put me in the will again!  lol"
340,"Orijen dry dog food is relatively new to me, (approx. 8 months) but not only does my German Shepherd love it..right out of the bag..but I always taste a sample myself! (Not something I would normally do with just any dog food). You'll find after opening the sturdy bag, the aroma of the Orijen dog food catches your sense of smell like a freshly brewed cup of coffee, or a piece of your favorite meat or fish.  I usually buy the blue bag of free-run chichen and fish product because I find it contains the most appropriate ingredients for my German Shepherd. When the box of food is delivered, she is immediately scratching the box to help me open it..she knows it's for her and can't wait to get her teeth into it. LORI, Phila."
341,"I purchased this product both for my dog and my daughters dog and it gave them both extreme diarrhea, explosive poor pups couldn't even make it out of the house. VERY embarrassed dogs!!! Both dogs suffered from this product.  We administered the exact amount for the weight of each dog.  They both LOVE their Greenies so I was shocked with this reaction."
342,It has come to my attention that coconut product sweetened with sugar actually has fewer calories than the unsweetened product. Anyone know why? It seems only logical that sugar sweetened coconut would have more calories.
343,Very nice product.  It was fresh and in date and shipped quickly.  Thanks.
344,"Great coffee. I love this k-cup flavor. Delicious full bodied coffee for bold coffee lovers, doesn't disappoint. I always buy in bulk, because the price per cup decreases, but also because I KNOW I'm going to drink a lot. Love this coffee!"
345,"Currently we use only Pedigree Puppy dinner's and products, it's my number one choice, the puppies love this product, it provide, excellent nutritional value, and has never been on the list of recalled products to date. Pedigree web site is always happy to send you any information you ask of them concerning a product they sell. They will also keep you informed, if by chance there is any problem with their products, simply visit the site, and request product updates. Highly reccomend, and have used Pedigree, for more than 20 years."
346,You just can't buy muesli like this in the USA at a local store!  This shipped very quickly and the cereal is wonderful.  Thanks for providing such great service.
347,"Good products<br />Love Diet Energy 5/5 and Diet Root Beer 5/5<br /><br />a couple stinkers -<br />Diet Fountain Mist (Mountain Dew-like, tart fake flavor) 1/5<br />Diet Dr. Pete (Weak flavor, not bold like Dr. Pepper) 3/5<br /><br />Amazon - Do better on price! This is 5.99 to 6.99 in the stores (you are charging double)<br />Sodastream - Reformulate these two!"
348,"I really love raisins and always keep a large box in the pantry; this probably explains my disappointment with Kellogg's Raisin Bran Crunch Cereal, it doesn't have enough raisins to suit me. I have found other brands of crunchy raisin bran cereal that have a lot more raisins. Kellogg's advantage is its wide availability; you can find it at most stores.<br /><br />The obvious solution is to add some raisins out of my raisin box to the cereal which is exactly what I do. I'm always a little disappointed when I have to do that.<br /><br />I have found the sweetness to be just right for me and enjoy the cereal right down to the bottom of the bowl. I also enjoy adding almonds to the cereal or even a banana. This is a favorite of my mine for supper and I enjoy it several times a week."
349,This store was very easy to deal with my item was in stock and shipped as promised with no delays.  I was very happy that they carry the beans and had them in stock at a fair price.
350,"I ordered the Original Blend of Dunkin Donuts and received a hazelnut flavored version.  In addition, I was charged 18.00 each for 12 oz packages.  The local market charges 9.00 each.  I don't want the hassel involved in returning this order, but I won't order food items from Amazon again, EVER!"
351,My dog and foster dogs have done well on this food. It is the best priced quality grain free food there is to my knowledge. Amazon's price beats my local stores (including Petco when you factor in the sales tax I pay when I buy in the store). As an Amazon prime customer I was thrilled to see this included in free 2 day shipping- absolutely can't beat this deal!<br />Amazon shipped it in a cardboard box about the same size as the bag and it arrived with the box looking quite the worse for wear. Since Wellness comes in a Mylar bag the bag itself was fine and I was home so brought it right in. If you were  not going to be home when this was delivered and your deliveries are left outside I would be concerned about other animals getting to it. Even with the Mylar bag my dog can rip into this in no time flat and racoons and rats (I live next to a wooded area!) love dog food! Probably not a big deal mid-day but just something to consider. I would not buy food that ships in a paper bag from Amazon- at least not a larger bag (>15lbs) but that is just my experience/opinion. I am thrilled that amazon offers this and would order again from them but will make sure I am home when it is to be delivered.
352,"One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!"
353,"INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called ""Sparkling Pomegranate"" would be ""pure juice made from Apple""...which goes on to list in this order ""White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate.""  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider."
354,"A one-ounce package consists of a little over a dozen bites. This package has only 18 oz in it... and is way overpriced! I bought a 1 oz package from Walmart for $0.88. I've tried the orange, apple, and pomegranite flavors and all are really yummy and no artificial ingredients although I don't see any pomegrante in the ingredient list for that flavor. They are mostly made of apple, very soft, chewy, and just about melt in your mouth.<br /><br />If Amazon becomes more reasonable on their bulk packaging... I'll be picking them up here, otherwise I'll buy them individually.<br /><br />They do come in a resealable ziploc package but not enough in a 1 oz to really ""keep"" for long so I feel it's a wasted benefit. However, if the bulk packages were 5 or 6 oz, then the ziploc would be great (and the price would be more fitting)!"
355,"Being from the Southern US, I've been drinking iced tea since I was a child. We've always used, I might say with satisfaction, Lipton or Luzianne brands until my wife brought this brand home from the store. The blend of teas used is fragrant and rich. The end product is very clear, but very dark and has a long finish with no bitterness or strong after-taste.<br /><br />I use the instructions on the side of the box (2 bags to 4 cups of almost boiling water and steep for 4 minutes) except I don't dilute it with equal parts of fresh water. Instead, I pack a tall glass (not plastic) to the brim with ice, spoon in the desired amount of sugar or sweetener (I use Splenda Blend) and then pour the hot tea over the ice. Stir briskly and enjoy. It tends to dilute itself almost perfectly for me.<br /><br />I now purchase it here on Amazon, and since I'm a Prime Member, and get free shipping, it comes out to be more economical than buying it in smaller amounts in the local grocer."
356,"My stepdad loved the berries.  A little bit expensive to ship them; but for a birthday gift, they were very much appreciated."
357,Great tasting.  It's all that I expected it would be.  Recommend purchasing.  Get two jars as the shipping cost doesn't increase.
358,Another great tasting gluten free product.  Has lots of flavor and because they are individually wrapped they are great to include in a packed lunch.
359,These Kaps work well and as advertised. The machine however was unreliable and broke within 5 days of getting it (Breville BKC700XL). I returned it to Amazon for a refund as well as the Kaps since I no longer needed them.
360,Very tasty pumpkin.  Pumpkin is in low supply and I was pleased to find it on amazon at a reasonable price.
361,"These cookies, while they don't look like the one being broken on the package (maybe if heated?), have great taste, and stay chewy even if refrigerated.  I found them delicious and tried to hide the box from myself in order to try to make them last longer than a day (I was successful ... barely).  They are definitely a big step-up from standard chips ahoy (which I would rate as ""OK"")."
362,"Dogs LOVE Greenies!  They go crazy if they even think they hear the greenie bag...my tiny little Italian Greyhound girl gets a greenie at bedtime, and sometimes she starts pushing us to go to bed and getting wild and begging to go to bed, because she wants her greenie.  You do have to be careful and only feed them one a day of their size range, or they will upset their stomach...you can have too much of a good thing, but as long as you don't overdo it, the dogs love them, and it's a great treat for them!"
363,"I've eaten these boxed meals for years; in fact ever since I was a kid, and I must say this one is better than average.  It's easy to prepare and has a real home made taste unlike it's competitors.  If you're looking for something tasty to do with ground beef that's quick and easy you should give this a try."
364,"Considering this is a low carb mix, it tastes pretty good. The consistency is different than regular mixes. But if you are on a low carb diet it's worth using."
365,This is my second order from this company and they ship incredibly fast. I order on-line in the afternoon and the dog food is here within 24 hours. I do not pay any extra for that service. I chose this brand because it has quality ingrediants and is hormone free.
366,If you are looking for something natural to relieve (and possible stop) hot flashes--sage tea will do it. A glass in the morning and one at night and WOW what a difference it made!
367,Not what I was expecting and will not order again. I was looking for dried fruit. This product was powdery and what wasn't was hard.
368,"Disgusting!  I have never tasted anything more awful.  I went along with the other reviews and thought that I would try this product.  I have tried other products from this maker and enjoyed everything.  However, this apple cider smelled and tasted awful.  So if anyone is considering this item, think twice before you buy."
369,"I see a lot of complaints about Grove Square hot chocolate. I think it tastes ok considering it's a k-cup, not homemade and not gourmet. I don't have anything negative to say the company or the product, it's relatively inexpensive and the company didn't falsely advertise or make any promises about the taste."
370,i love ordering on line esp from amazon>> just as i am about to run out of coffee i get a email re special deals<br />and i simply order and in a day the products are shipped<br />this coffee is fantastic<br />try it<br />also donut shop is great
371,"Our whole family LOVES this popcorn!  It tastes just like the theater's!  When we first purchased our Lincoln Popper from Discount Tommy, I thought I would just make my own blend of salt, butter and other spices.  But I could never get it just right.  After trying Great Northern's theater popcorn, I thought, ""Why?""  Not only is the flavor perfect, but the price is right!<br /><br />I love the subscription program with Amazon.  Not only do you receive a discount, but they will automatically send you your popcorn at intervals that you choose.  I'll NEVER run out of popcorn again!!!  Thanks Discount Tommy and Amazon.com."
372,"These Good Health All Natural Kettle Style Olive Oil Potato Chips are beyond delicious. In fact, we found it difficult to consume one serving size.<br /><br />At first, we were hesitant about purchasing this because often one never knows what they are buying by a limited description alone.  However, we were glad to have assumed the risk with these.<br /><br />The flavor balance includes a perfect amount of salt (not too much), healthy olive oil (non-greasy), and a hint of something special. This simple treat will greatly reward your taste buds, if they are attuned with ours."
373,"Our cat is allergic to grain and just loves this food as a special treat.  With the shipping, the cost is too high to use it as a main food, so we cook his everyday meals."
374,"We tried so many different foods with this. The sour foods were surprisingly super sweet. It also made blueberries taste like Foghorn Leghorn, I say, I say!"
375,We were so happy to find the Smokehouse Natural small chicken chips on your website. Our little dog loves them and they have been hard to obtain locally.
376,"I am ordering my second bag. I like the flavor, and you can't find papaya for cheaper, so it's a good value. There is probably room for improvement in the taste department, but I really like it and that's all that matters. I buy it to share with my bunnies instead of buying the $4-$6 4oz bags when it is the same thing. They also love it :)"
377,"My favorite thing about this K-cup Cappuccino is that it does NOT taste artificial!!!!  I purchased a personalized variety pack of K-cups on amazon and this cup was included.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone who is sensitive to the artificial flavoring of many K-cups.  This tastes smooth, creamy, and sweet (bc of the caramel).  It tastes like it could have come straight from the coffee shop, really!<br /><br />You don't have to add any cream or anything because it is already included in the cup.  The only complaint that I can imagine others might have is its level of sweetness, if they don't like sweet cappuccinos, but then don't purchase one that is caramel flavored right?"
378,"Clearbrook Farmas makes the best preserves around.  Plus they know that service is paramount to maintaining good customer relations.  They expidite your order as soon as received. I have tried the Orange Marmalade, Black Cherry and Strawberry. All were exceptional. Because the container is so unusual I think this would make excellent Xmas gifts.  If you haven't tried preserves form Clearbrook Farms you are REALLY missing out."
379,"While I am no fan of coffee, other members in my household love it.  This got rave reviews.<br /><br />This looks like it comes in a tea bag.  It's easy to make; you just brew it for a few minutes and wring it out.  You can make it the way you make tea by applying the bag concept.  This was a big hit with the coffee hounds.<br /><br />."
380,"Natural, butter-free microwave popcorn is becoming very hard to find.  Thank goodness Newman's Own follows its usual high quality with this product.  The bag pops almost completely and the contents tastes just like popcorn, not like the greasy artificial quasi-butter-like-substance most microwave popcorns taste like.  If you want butter, melt some real stuff and put it on yourself.  But personally, this stuff doesn't need it."
381,"WHILE YOU SELL MANY DIFFERENT BRANDS, AND I HAVE TRIED A FEW DIFFERENT ONES, VITACOCO<br /><br />IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST.  MY FAMILY AND I DRINK MORE OF THIS THAN WE DO ANY OTHER DRINK."
382,i am very 'picky' about my pepper........this is a unique taste.i like the berries 'whole' on salad or steak.
383,My Mother said candy is very good!!!!!  I would buy it again.  Only 1 problem shipped loosely.  So candy  tumbles around in shipping and looks yucky or old and beaten up when you get it.  Sad as I sent it as a gift.
384,"Quinoa is, in my opinion, rather a miracle food, that has resolved many of my long-standing health problems. But this is not about Quinoa, but rather Ka&ntilde;iwa. Some refer to Ka&ntilde;iwa as ""baby quinoa"", which is an easy way to understand it. It is very similar to quinoa in the ways it is handled, processed and cooked. It is not just small quinoa, though, but a distinct breed. Ka&ntilde;iwa = Chenopodium pallidicaule while Quinoa = Chenopodium quinoa. You see? Different.<br /><br />There are important differences in processing and use. For processing, Quinoa when harvested is covered with a bitter unpleasant tasting compound (saponins). These make it easier to grow since it is pest-resistent, but requires special processing to remove the saponins. Ka&ntilde;iwa does not have this issue, which means you don't need to check how the grain was processed prior to purchase. For use, the ka&ntilde;iwa is more finely-grained than quinoa. Quinoa is larger and after cooking similar in size to uncooked rice. Ka&ntilde;iwa is smaller, which gives it a smoother texture. The question is really what texture you prefer. Nutritionally, they seem to be similar, although we haven't studied these very long and need more nutritional research. Specifically taking advantage of the fine texture of ka&ntilde;iwa, I like to use it in custards, breakfast dishes, desserts, cream pies, and similar foods, since it works well in creamy textured foods while adding protein and fiber and making the dishes more nutritious. I tend to use quinoa more in salads, pilafs, tabbouleh, and similarly textured dishes."
385,"Great new product; low sugar, low calories. It's delicious and healthy after a hard workout or long day."
386,"I have been on a long quest for ""nutrition bars"" (or whatever you want to call them) that don't have refined sugar, aren't too sweet (however they're sweetened), don't have soy, and generally don't have extra crud in them. These are perfect!<br /><br />I like the flavor, and I like that the ingredients list is so short: ""dates, almonds, and cherries"". (200 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber. See larabar dot com for more.)<br /><br />They are a little bit gooier/processed than I was expecting... I had to check after a taste that there wasn't soy in there gluing everything together. But when I think about fruit leather that makes sense. In some ways, it's like a thick fruit leather with some larger bits of fruit and nuts.<br /><br />But I'm really glad to find them and will be trying more flavors. This is just the sort of bar I was hoping for.<br /><br />Update: My next favorite flavor so far is Chocolate Coconut Chew, which should not be mistaken for a candy bar-type snack, as I feared it might. It's not that sweet and not that chocolately. It's more substantial. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, walnuts, unsweetened cocoa powder, unsweetened coconut"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 5g fiber... and I'm sorry I don't have the energy right now to type the rest. (Ah! But you can get it online if you put a dot com after larabar!)<br /><br />I also like Ginger Snap enough to have bought a box. They are, yes, a little cookie-ish (though with the same gooey consistency as the rest). I do love ginger, but I don't find myself reaching for this flavor and probably won't reorder. Ingredients: ""Dates, almonds, pecans, ginger, cinnamon, cloves"". 240 calories, 5g protein, 6g fiber.<br /><br />Other flavors I have tried (Note that I prefer less sweet things, although all of them have a dose of sweet)<br />  * Tropical Fruit Tart: I won't get this again; for me this was like a pina colada and not what I want in a food bar (partly, this means it was too sweet for me, but also all the desert-y flavors in that bar)<br />  * Peanut Butter and Jelly: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Cashew Cookie: Good, and I imagine I'll add it to my bulk rotation<br />  * Lemon Bar: Too desert-y for me. Sweet and lemony.<br /><br />(Looking at the larabar web site, Peanut Butter Cookie has the most protein, with 7g, at 220 calories and with 4g fiber... I haven't been able to get that in my local stores yet, but that will be the next flavor I try.)<br /><br />Update 2: So I have bought a few flavors by the box now... but I'm realizing I wonder why these aren't cheaper here. They are 1.39 individually in my grocery store, and 1.27 a piece by the box at the current subscribe and save price of 20.28. So yes, that's a savings, but possibly not enough to buy in bulk."
387,"Love the tea, especially if brewed strong and then added to my decaf tea, gives it a good hint of flavor. Wish the bags were bigger and better to use for a large container of tea, instead of a cup. Good price!"
388,"I paid for 2-3 day delivery. The item is now scheduled for 5 day delivery. If I had agreed to five day delivery, I would not have been charged shipping. I have been charged for 2-3 day delivery and received 5 day service."
389,"Excellent balance with a slightly sweet taste and wonderful aroma. Since it's not overly strong or hot, it's very versatile with any number of dishes.  Stores well in the fridge and the value for the money is fantastic. If you like curry, this is a great buy."
390,"Safely arrived in a good time frame.  This sweetner is much better than Stevia, which is too concentrated.  Purelo Lo Han Sweetner is mild yet sweet."
391,"How many times have I had to throw out old spices, I've lost count.  This is one of the best ideas on the market.  Tins full of individually packaged spices to keep in your cupboard ready, premeasured, and convenient.  This makes a great housewarming gift for friends who love to cook or bake.  I think the kits that they have put together are wonderful, but you can purchase the spices you want a la carte too."
392,"I love this tea.  The blend of green tea and toasted rice is delicious.<br /><br />I typically drink my Gen Mai Cha in the afternoon - when I'm looking for a little pick me up.  The toasted rice has a nutty aroma that is really satisfying, and the caffeine level is perfect - wakes me up without keeping me up all night.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea if you are a green tea lover looking to try something new."
393,"I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell. I love the aroma! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers 'n' onions. Well, it doesn't last forever that way. I tried another brand of five spices but it didn't even begin to compare to Dynasty. There isn't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon. True, the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores. This was worth it!"
394,"This is the best popcorn I've ever tasted hands down. The taste is unlike anything I've had before and I was hooked after the very 1st bag! I can really tell that it's all natural, it doesn't give me stomach aches like a lot of other popcorn with junk in it does.<br /><br />I was surprised by the flavor. Usually I'm not a huge fan of rosemary, but this is mixed with the parmesan cheese and the flavors really complement eachother well. Simply amazing!<br /><br />My only gripe is that it's just ""slightly"" expensive for what it is. Even if the 3 pack was $1.50 less that would be appreciated."
395,"This has been discontinued in local stores.  ""Quick"" grits is like instant coffee, no flavor.  What dope stocks 10 styles of instant coffee and removes the real coffee from the shelf????"
396,"I'm a Dark Roast kinda guy and Jet Fuel is pretty darn good !! I love the Sumatra but, for the cost difference, this product is GREAT !! The packaging ROCKS too !!!"
397,I had a friend introduce this to me so I bought it at Target. I loved it. It was great in my oatmel and coffee and it was much easier to pour than honey. I checked on Amazon and got it for a better price. The shipment was quick and nothing had leaked. I would definitely recommend this product.
398,"I normally purchase the Lavazza Grand Crema pods for use with my Breville espresso machine, and have always been happy with them but wanted to try something different, so I ordered a box of Espressione Classic Espresso instead. Initially I was very disappointed with the results; a 30-second shot of espresso using these pods contained only about half as much liquid as one using my normal Lavazza pods (in other words, the water was passing through these pods at a much slower rate than through the Lavazza). Maybe my machine is lacking in pressure... but I could tell just by the feel of the pods that these are much more tightly packed than the Lavazza ones.<br /><br />My disappointment changed to delight when I tried these pods out on my Handpresso Wild, however. I had never really liked the taste of the Lavazza pods using this machine (seemed much more bitter compared to my ""real"" machine at home), but with Espressione it was perfect!<br /><br />Bottom line... if you are using a Handpresso, I recommend these pods 100%. If you are using a normal espresso machine, you may want to try out a smaller size package before committing to 150 pods."
399,"If you like a very dark roast coffee with deep intense flavor without that ""burned"" taste and zero bitter flavor, this is it. Search no further. We now buy no other."
400,"I actually thought I was buying the Van Houtte vanilla coffee k-cups that I usually purchase and I overlooked the description of ""light."" It certainly is. You can barely taste the vanilla. It's good coffee, but if you're looking for a real vanilla flavor, go with the Van Houtte k-cups that are in a darker yellow package."
401,My wife and kids LOVED these cookies! They are very tasty and have a nice fudge center. The only complaint is that a good 2/3 of the box was crumbs. This was due to shipping. I suppose if you ordered several boxes at once they would be better cushioned. As part of Vine we received just 1 box and it was fairly beat up.<br /><br />Overall we liked the cookies and would recommend them to chocolate lovers anywhere!<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.
402,"I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol"
403,"Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once  a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free. I also note, over a few months, that skin bumps are disappearing. I've tried several top brands, and this seems the most healthful."
404,"Ok, so I'm always on the lookout for substitute drinks for soda.  Because I just can't give up that fizziness, or the caffeine, or something.  And while these Sparkling Ice drinks may not have caffeine, they definitely have the fizz that I so enjoy in my drinks.  And the flavors aren't half bad either.  In fact, this Pink Grapefruit one is one of the better ones.<br /><br />I don't like grapefruit.  So why did I buy a flavored drink with that then?  Well there's something about this grapefruit taste that I like.  It's not too sour, but not too sweet either.  And considering I avoid the real fruit I can't say whether or not that it tastes like the real thing, I would think it's probably pretty close.  But it's just good, easy to drink, and definitely refreshing.  And there isn't an overabundance of flavors to get crazy with.<br /><br />The ingredients; they actually aren't too bad.  The list isn't very long, and the flavorings are natural.  There's actual grapefruit in this bottle.  There's even green tea extract.  The problems come in the form of color.  There is a type of red dye in this drink.  And I'm not too impressed with that.  I'd rather they have made it a healthier drink and it be some other color or clear.  Honestly, I think I'd even pay more if they made it that way.  But this low list of ingredients has some other positives that come with it too.  There are 0 calories and 0 sugars in this drink.  Which is incredible.  And there's even some B vitamins thrown in too.<br /><br />So while the dye makes it a tad less than healthy, this is still a pretty good soda substitute.  It's healthy, still has the fizz, and tastes good.  I definitely will keep buying it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012"
405,I CANT REVIEW THIS FOOD...BECAUSE THE KIBBLE SIZE IS  H  U  G  E<br />UNLESS YOU HAVE A GIGANTIC DOG....I DO NOT THINK YOUR SM-MED DOG WILL WANT TO CHEW THESE! IM SO UPSET BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE CAN OF THIS WANTED TO MIX THE SAME AS CAN WITH THE DRY!
406,This tea is very flavorful. The pyramidal tea bags seem to allow more flavor to infuse. I would buy this again.
407,What can I say? This stuff is AMAZING! I cook with it almost exclusively. It makes the VERY BEST pie crust I ever ate. You can't go wrong. This is also a great value.
408,"These are wonderful and so fresh!  After buying a box for our family I reordered another and surprised my sisters with a box. The only problem was they didn't want to share, it was a good thing the individually wrapped candies were really big! Cherry Mash was always our mother's favorite in the 1950's as well as ours...we are so glad to find it at Amazon. They still make it taste just as good now as I remember. Will definitely order more...maybe next time I will even get them their very own box of 24....it sure made them happier than flowers, I can still hear the excitement in my sister's voice when she called to thank me!"
409,You can buy this at the source for 4$ and at other stores for 3-5$' so why is it so much more on amazon???
410,"Strong trap, but perhaps too strong. The spring bar bent under the spring's weight very early. Afterwards it was impossible to set and would snap before it was even set in the ground. Eventually the jaw cracked in half at the top.<br />Going to need to try something else."
411,"We have been trying out decafs to find good strong ones. I was so hopeful when I opened the box covered with exclamations of  'BAM!' and 'Oh Yeah, Babe!'. That first cup was a huge watery letdown. I can only say that it is not acidic. I tried it a few more times and now it is the coffee that the kids are allowed to drink. Weak, sad decaf."
412,"I've recently started eating the Ezekiel cereals and find them very satisfying. When eaten alone, it doesn't have much flavor. It's pretty obvious why.... There's no processing here. Without fruit, it's still satisfying with Vanilla Soy Milk. However, if eaten as pictured with Blue berries, the cereal really tastes good. You get a satisfying cereal with a good amount of fiber. I've been hearing a lot about sprouted grains and I'm not sure what it really means in the end, but this cereal is pure. Which is something I appreciate."
413,"Well, scratch this one off the list! For some stupid, unfathomable reason ol' Betty Crocker decided to add SOY flour. Haven't they heard of the eight major allergen list, and that some of us react to SOY and gluten?<br /><br />Dumb, dumb, dumb. Back to Namaste for me."
414,"It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!"
415,Amy's products are the best and If you buy from Amazon you can subscribe and ship and it is a great price it is much more in stores love it
416,"I got this after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine."
417,"Nice chew to it, a little on the dry side, but that's how I like it. It has a very strong teriyaki taste and a little heat. Could use more heat and less sugar, but that's some good jerky."
418,The Clementine flavor tastes just like the fruit. So many think it should taste like an Orange.. but its not.. I have a Clementine tree in my back yard.
419,"My dogs just love the food and they look great! Their coats are shiny, no more scratching or itching. I also love the free shipping and price! Don't be afraid to give this a try, your dogs will thank you!!"
420,"This is a wonderful item.  I have used it on both boneless and bone-in chicken.  Tastes great! Easy to apply, large container should be enough to last for quite some time."
421,"I've been eating these for years and they are yummy. Great low carb snack that can be taken on-the-go, without refrigeration. So glad Amazon started carrying and has the subscription option."
422,These are very light and delicious crackers.  They go well in soup or with cheese.  My children love them.
423,"Not much to say about fast, flavored oatmeal.  It tastes good, is really easy to fix in a couple of minutes, and is reasonably good for you.  I like this stuff."
424,Off all of the different types of Ramen that I have had this is the best thus far.  I highly recommend to any who enjoys Ramen and spicy foods.
425,These have a stronger caramel flavor although still a medium strength coffee.  The best caramel flavored K-cup I've tried!  I will reorder them.
426,"Ideal is a must try sweetener for those who rely on artificial sweeteners. It contains the same sweetening ingredient as sugar-free gum (xylitol) and is absolutely the best I've tried as far as imitating sugar. There is no after taste! It comes in a granulated, powdered and brown sugar version. The best!<br /><br />Warning: this product can be very hazardous to pets! The package is labelled as such (it states along with chocolate,grapes etc.) so be very careful not to leave it out where they can get at it. Their digestive system does not handle the enzymes the same way as humans."
427,"I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles."
428,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
429,"I like the taste of coke and pepsi, if I had to choose between both of them I would choose Pepsi.  The soda stream cola is awful.  I can normally drink any soda, but this one is almost undrinkable.  I gave it two stars because it is better for the environment."
430,I really like this coffee.  It is dark and strong just like I like coffee to be.  And it is also a great value.
431,"i'm watching my calorie intake - and after reading all the reviews, i had to try this.<br />its truly amazing.<br />my favorite is to add 1 tbs. to about 1/2 cup vanilla fat free yogurt for breakfast. SO good!"
432,"I like the flavor of this popcorn. It's a little on the salty side, but just right with the butter and pepper flavor. For some reason, these small bags don't do so well in my microwave. I set it for the recommended 1:30 on high and still get a few burned popped pieces and a handful of unpopped kernels. If I cook it for less time, I get an unacceptable number of unpopped kernels, and any longer, too many burned popped pieces. I also tried the ""popcorn"" setting and get the same result as 1:30 on high. I don't have any problems with the regular sized bags of buttered flavor popcorn."
433,"This is a cool organic fruit snack great for all ages not just kids.  I was looking for an organic fruit snack for my sons lunch box and this  is prefect.  Great prepackaged, keeps well, no refrigeration required. Great for  on the go, lunch boxes, camping, picnics, anytime.  I can keep organic fruit on the shelf now ready anytime.<br /><br />We are never put off by labels like for tots or babies ,unfortunately  most of the organic snacks seem to be geared toward them.  My son loves bananas and apple sauce, so we thought we would try this.  So he calls this his  banana sauce.  He even wanted to freeze it . So we popped it in freezer and then cut off the bottom for a banana sorbet. He loved it.<br /><br />Also he loves the caps and is collecting  them to make something. They have holes so could be strung together."
434,"I received a box of Nantucket free with my coffee maker but it didn't sound like anything special so I put off trying it, but now it is my favorite!  It is slightly stronger than coffee people coffee shop but has a richer and more flavorful taste.  Not bitter at all, but if you like lighter roasts then you probably will not like this.  I think it tastes best using the 7-8 ounce setting.  This reminds of when I dine out and they have such good coffee but either they don't know or won't tell you what kind it is.  Love it!"
435,"I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog."
436,"Simply put, this pomegranate licorice is really tasty and yummy, it's actually some of the best licorice I have tasted. I love its great pomegranate taste, and the fact that it is organic is a nice added bonus. If I were rating this solely on taste, I would give it *5* stars. But then I looked at the price... I mean I am lucky that I got offered this for free thanks to vine, but what about the normal costumer? So I simply have to point out that I feel that the price is expensive for a 5 oz bag, and that's why I can't give it 5 stars.<br /><br />In the end, this pomegranate licorice is one delicious treat!"
437,"I can't review this product as yet, because I ordered it as a gift and my friend's birthday hasn't happened."
438,"I am about to reorder my second package of this brand of casing. As an occasional home user, I am very happy with the amount of sausage I have made with this product (I use it with a KitchenAid grinder and LEM stuffer). It is necessary to run water on the inside of the casing after soaking. Convenient to use and store!"
439,"I purchased a Single Cup coffee maker for $7.00 at Walmart.  It came with a free package of Senseo Coffee Pods.  We Were Hooked.  Then Walmart quit selling Senseo, and Amazon quit selling it.  And where I could find it, it was Way too Expensive.<br />So I decided to try Melitta Coffee Pods.  Really they are Every Bit as Good or Better than Senseo Coffee Pods.<br />I like the Medium Roast.  It is Very Mellow, and smooth.  Not bitey at all.<br />The only problem I have, is that I can only drink two cups a day.  But If I could, I would drink it All Day !!!<br />Great Stuff !!"
440,"Almonds are a super snack and at that price dear family get to enjoy a healthy, economically friendly to the budget night time nibbley."
441,"Not only do these delicious snacks taste like fresh,Spring peas, they look like slender pale green pods. They have a delicate, satisfying crunch, look festive scattered on a salad or can be eaten right out of the bag. Just a few healthful ingredients, low calories and intriguing flavor have given me a new favorite.  Still not found in any of my local stores in a really big city, order yours now and see what I mean!"
442,I like this one better than all the other ones by Earths Best. The variety is good and my son seems to enjoy them all.<br /><br />If i am going away for a weekend this is perfect for feedings. It is packaged well and again the variety helps!
443,"The Zevia Root Beer Flavor is one of my favorites of the Zevia flavors.  It has very strong Root Beer taste which I find tastes a lot like my memories of A&W Root Beer back when I was growing up in Canada, back before they started replacing sugar with High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I'm not sure if A&W Root Beer is different here in the US from Canada, as the food in the A&W restaurants here in the US is nothing like the food in A&W Canada restaurants.<br /><br />In any case, I love that there's nothing but all natural ingredients here, and it's naturally sugar free.  This summer, I often combined the Zevia Root Beer with Clemmy's Sugar Free Vanilla Bean Ice Cream to make my own Sugar Free Root Beer Floats (and sometimes with Orange Zevia instead of the Root Beer) and they were absolutely amazing guilt free Floats."
444,This is an excellent product and my dog is thriving on it.  It is healthy and no filler.  I also like the convenience of having it delivered to the house and I don't have to carry it.
445,Great baby foods!  I like the variety pack.  Much cheaper than buying it from the local grocers or co-op!  I Just wish they came in the squeezie pouches!
446,"This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky."
447,Out of all the cereals I have ever tasted this is the best tasting and feels great to be eating something healthy. The ingredients are all organic and there is some amazingly healthy stuff packed into this box. I actually look forward to a healthy breakfast with this. I get the boxes shipped to work and keep them under my desk. A quick and healthy breakfast that tastes amazing!
448,These pop chips are a great altenative to potato chips. Less fat but tons of flavor. I highly recommend these. My whole family loves them.
449,You only need a small pinch of this salt to add loads of a unique flavor to your food.<br /><br />Very good!
450,"As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!"
451,"I LOVE these cookies!  As a Type 1 diabetic and a Weight Watcher I still have a strong craving for sweets and chocolate in particular!  This cookie packet solves it all for me!  They give me the great taste of sweet chocolate without the guilt of blowing my diabetic or my weight loss diets!  And I feel like I get so many of them since they're small!  I also love the fact that they're portioned out for me.<br />I can't say enough about these cookies and cannot wait until they're available on the shelves again!  Please hurry, Murray! :)"
452,"At only 20 calories per cup, with its rich, chocolate taste, this is a best buy. Also, zero cholesterol. It can't be beat!"
453,"I've wanted to try truffles for quite a while, but haven't found anything in my budget until now.  I'm already a big fan of this company, and their other salts, so knew I was off to a good start when I found this.  It is VERY good.  The truffle flavor is there (sort of an 'umami' quality), but not overbearing.  I can use the right amount of salt for my taste, and get ""enough"" truffle flavor to notice it.  I had also ordered a white truffle oil (not the same company), and it's ""ok""....but this black truffle salt is REALLY good- already have 2 more in my cart !!"
454,"I discovered these KIND bars at the airport. They are pretty good for you and taste great !  Just what I have been searching for!  If only Pizza was good for you, I would be all set !"
455,this product has always arrived on time never been any issues. i switched to this brand from a perscription only brand and it works just as good but less cost than the perscription only one. my cat's urine hasn't smelled like amonia since i started using this and havent had any accidents outside the litter box unlike before. Love this product!!
456,"Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.  It's an excellent combination of chocolate and raspberry, where one flavor does not overpower the other.  It's my new favorite K-cup, and I will definitely buy more when this supply runs out!"
457,"we usually buy trader joe's brand which we love - this brand isn't as crispy - much softer and as a snack for the kids to eat in the car, it's actually less messy.  i don't find it quite as tasty, but the kids love it.  when i first tried it i thought maybe moisture had leaked in, but on opening other jars realised it was just a different texture and it definitely grew on me."
458,"I never liked tomato sauce on my pasta until I tried this cherry tomato sauce. It's naturally a little sweeter than most sauces, is quite peppery, and is, as the other commenter noted, very fresh tasting. It tastes almost as good as making a slow-cooked sauce yourself. I'm excited to find this sauce on Amazon, as my Costco no longer carries it."
459,"TIMOTHY'S GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE K-CUP IS NOW MY #1 FLAVOR, I HAVE MY BEST FRIEND HOOK TO THIS FLAVOR AS WELL.  YOU CAN TASTE FROM THE CHOCOLATE TO THE COCONUT, YUMMY, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK TIMOTHY'S."
460,I love these treats they are great for training. I also put them in the treat ball to keep my dog occupied while I am not home. They are the perfect size for all my treat balls. And the price was great.<br />Thanks
461,I love Organix wet food but this particular formula seemed to upset my cat's GI. She had diarrhea and then stopped eating for a few days ANY food. I tried introducing the same formula again as a snack and now she won't touch it. She had no problems with the turkey rice chicken formula and continues to eat that formula.Wondering if it was the spinach that upset her. Still a great brand and great company.
462,"I love coffee, I love mochas, I love amaretto.<br />This product however was disgusting !!!"
463,"Good tea. Lemon is pretty good when served warm, even though it's typically thought of as a cold beverage. If you like it, the multi-pack is a good way to save money."
464,"I was hoping to find a green tea with very little caffeine; no ""decaffeinated"" tea has no caffeine. This one, however, still made me jittery; I could feel the effects immediately."
465,"I love these chips and they are a perfect low fat snack to keep me held over through my day.  The only thing bad about the Amazon price is they are about $20 for a 24 pack.  That is 80 cents each.  Sadly I discovered this great snack at work in the vending machine - for 75 cents.  I would expect to buy them for .50 a pack if I have to buy 24 and not from a vending machine.  I highly recommend these chips, but there is no savings buying the from Amazon."
466,"I bought mine at Whole Foods and it was a smaller more beautiful packaged glass container than the other nutellas and more expensive but I figure since it came directly from Italy, it would have to be higher in quality, especially being organic.  If you like OVERLY sweet chocolate paste, then it's for you.  Based on the amazon ad, it's supposed to be used for desserts.  I instead wanted to use it as they do in Europe on bread or waffles or butter wafer cookies.  But, I found myself having to grab a gallon of water after every taste.  I would prefer it to have less sugar like Justin's ""nutella"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JG5TVS"">Justin's Nut Butter Natural Chocolate Hazelnut Blend, 16 Ounce plastic jars (Pack of 3)</a>"
467,Navitas Naturals Chia seed have become a favorite. It was easy to set up the next delivery date to enjoy these healthy seeds. I am sad Amazon has removed them from the auto-ship program. I will continue to buy them for as long as they are available for their health benefits.
468,"Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet."
469,"I'm always looking for a single-use coffee that is strong enough for my taste without using two pods ... this isn't it. In fact, I've had cheap instant coffee that taste better.<br /><br />I use my pod  for a quick cup or take them with me when I'm traveling, so I don't expect the product to taste like my fresh ground brewed coffee. But I do expect flavor. The flavor of this coffee was similar to re-used grounds.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality about this  Marley product is that it is a free-trade, organic product.<br /><br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the left-over packages because I don't want to insult guests by serving it. It seems a waste to just throw it away.  Maybe I can use it in the garden."
470,"As I am writing this review, I am sitting here, at my computer, wolfing down the food because I'm starving.<br /><br />I heated product in a saucepan over high heat for 5 minutes until boiling. Base tastes like regular tomato soup. Better than Campbell's tomato soup, I would say. There are vegetables mixed in: corn, green beans, and carrots. Green beans and carrots basically turn to mush in my mouth, and I can barely taste them. Corn isn't mushy, but doesn't taste sweet. I suspect this has something to do with being canned in a tomato base. Alphabet noodles have a nice texture. Smooth, and not too mushy.<br /><br />I love this soup. Very satisfying for something that is fat-free. Will re-purchase many times. I'm sure this would also make excellent kids' food."
471,Delicious! I ordered the french vanilla cappuccino because I was looking for something delicious that doesn't require the extra effort of adding cream and sugar. This is exactly that! I went through the 24 pack in 2-3 weeks and will definitely be ordering another box soon! I would recommend these for anyone that enjoys french vanilla flavor and normally adds cream and sugar to their coffee.
472,This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old nephew.  He was so excited to have it.  It is good quality and durable.
473,"Absolutely love Ella's Kitchen pouches.  The sweet potato, pumpkin, apples and blueberry one is my 12mo son's favorite, although my 5yo loves it as well.  I wish I had discovered them sooner.  Squeeze into a bowl for spoon feeding or let your little one drink directly from the pouch.  They're convenient and healthy - highly recommend!"
474,"Liked  this tea - it was different and refreshing.  It is bright red / maroon colored and makes for a very beautiful, refreshing tea when in a clear glass.  I drank it cold as iced tea."
475,"Lime and chili? When I saw that on the package, I was most intrigued! It seemed like an odd combination. But I like the taste of lime and I really like the zing of a good chili.<br /><br />Well, the label is half right. The taste of lime is really quite distinct and refreshing. I really enjoy that part of the equation. But from my experience with these chips, the chili taste is overpowered by the lime (or there was not much of the chili flavor to begin with).<br /><br />Still, the lime test is so refreshing!<br /><br />All in all, a good product because of the lime. But, in the end, rather unsatisfactory, because the pairing of lime and chili doesn't quite work."
476,"When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky, I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags. When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase, I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product. The person said no, they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up. Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer's web site to see what they changed.<br /><br />I was appalled by what I found. From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients. Chicken, natural smoke flavor. That's all.<br /><br />Here's the reformulated product ingredient list: Chicken, betaine, brown sugar, cultured dextrose, sea salt, natural smoke flavor, garlic powder, mixed tocopherols (preservative), paprika extract color, rosemary extract.<br /><br />I didn't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net. After reading about it, I still don't know what it is.<br /><br />The crude protein dropped from 77% to 50%.<br />crude fat increased from 2% to 5%.<br />moisture increased from 18% to 28%.<br /><br />I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.<br />____________________<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I just went to a new Petco that opened near me. I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats. Made in the US.<br /><br />Ingredients: Chicken breasts, natural flavorings.<br /><br />Crude protein 70%<br />Crude fat 3-7%<br />Moisture 10%<br /><br />I will be buying these when I run out of my old stock of True Chews."
477,"Surprisingly it works as prescribed. I used two cups for each tea bag however I only let the first cup steep no more then 5 minutes, then leave the tea bag in the second cup. It reduces the strong flavoring.<br /><br />I drink this tea and jog maybe twice a week and see results. With a more efficient work-out the tea would work better. I drink maybe 5 cups a day."
478,Best Jerky around as far as flavor.. a little fatty at times... sometimes not as dry as it should be
479,Was pleased to be able to get Flintstone candies as the party favor theme was this and used to make the favors.  The folks really liked them!
480,"What makes this product unique is how it has been packaged.  The baby food comes in pouches that have pourable spouts for ease of storing, packing for daycare, and you can open and shut them.  They are pourable and the plastic pouch is durable.  I personally didn't eat any of these organic baby meals but a friend's little boy did and he ate it all with no discernible complaints."
481,O.M.G. I am OBSESSED with Pomegranate Bai! It is so refreshing and a great low-cal product to refuel the antioxidants! It is a great drink to get me through my 3-hour classes each night! It is locally-based so I get really excited to see it in other places! I can't get enough of Bai!
482,"Since I was diagnosed with type II diabetes, This is the only drink I drink. It taste great and has enough sweetness to it to be very satisfying."
483,This is a tasty and satisfying treat. I don't like bars that are too sweet and this one is about right. Overall the chocolate and peanut butter flavors are subtle without overwhelming each other. I was hoping that they might be a bit less than 110 calories but that might be expecting too much. The bar is about the size of a Snickers bar (but Snickers have 273 calories). Plus they have 4 grams of protein which is pretty good for a bar this size. This bar will work well for an after meal snack and still keep you on track with your diet.
484,"I am sorry but the below reviewer is absolutely talking non-scence. I have 7 cats and 8 bags of these in my cabinets but I have gone days on end without giving these to ANY of my cats and they are absolutely fine. Also I run a shelter with a LOT of cats and have not had them acted like she sais.<br /><br />These cat treats have the ingredients on the label and just like any cat treat cats love them... My cats also love Party Mix, does that mean they are drugged product.<br /><br />That being said please do not listen to non-scence on these ratings.<br /><br />My cats do love these temptations... They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on ""people food""... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!"
485,"I was hesitant to order halvah long-distance instead of buying locally. So many times in my experience, I find that the product can be old and seriously dried out (it probably doesn't move very quickly here in the Midwest). But when I received this order from parthenonfoods.com, and immediately opened it, I was absolutely delighted at the product's FRESHNESS and deliciousness! I'll be ordering again soon from these folks. It's a pleasure to have found a vendor whose product quality I can trust. These folks deserve your attention! Check out <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRH58W"">Deli Fresh Marble Chocolate Halva, approx. 1lb</a>. (Thanks, Parthenon Foods!)"
486,"Love the packaging!! As for this flavor - my 2 yr old loved it but I thought it was not great, very thick."
487,"We're fans of the ""brown lid,"" natural-style, peanut butters... and Skippy doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The peanut flavor is strong, there's no oil separation (so no stirring is necessary) and the texture is very creamy / smooth.  As far as differences between this and the ""natural"" offerings of other brands, as long as we stick with the creamy variety my kids can't tell a difference... so we don't mind changing it up with whatever is on sale.<br /><br />That said, as long as Amazon continues to carry this 6-pack at a reasonable price with their S&S program, I anticipate that we'll continue to enjoy it."
488,Sorry Sicilia. I loved and bought your lemon product for years but happened to try True Lemon and it is superior. I drink lots of brewed ice tea and this product taste just like real fresh lemon and is easy to use.
489,"I've read lots of other reviews deeming this tea as ""coffee tasting"" or with ""roasted flavors,"" but to be very truthful, it tastes just the way I could imagine second hand smoke would. It's very very strong, requires 15 minutes to steep, and is not for the faint hearted. I've heard wonderful reviews related to weight loss regarding this product, but I was not able to tolerate the taste long enough to actually see any weight loss benefits. Good luck to those who care to brave this ""roasted"" flavor."
490,"Great product, great price from amazon while using the subscribe and save option. And natural ingredients (nothing you can't pronounce)"
491,"We found this in a spice shop while on vacation.  Being the Maker's Mark lovers that we are, we couldn't resist buying a bottle.  My wife decided that she wanted to make barbeque chicken last night, but realized we were out of barbeque sauce, then she remembered that we had this sauce.  The chicken turned out wonderful.  This sauce has a slightly sweet flavor with a hint of spice.  This is a must try for the Maker's Mark lovers out there.  Well, I have to run, I'm off to buy a case of this sauce on the Web!"
492,"I love this salt - it has all the minerals in it, no aftertaste, lasts a long time... and is a great texture."
493,My cat loves this food and it makes his coat so shiny!  The price for a flat of cans is also really good.
494,"My only complaint is that a couple bags of these outstanding pretzels arrived opened with the nuggets loosely living in the box.  The remaining bags have been delicious, with an almost nutty flavor and terrific texture.  I'd buy these again without hesitation."
495,The steaks came well sealed and packaged and were delicious. The price was right too for the size and quality of steaks that came.  I would recommend getting this product for the gourmet food lover in your life.
496,"This tea is wonderful. Delightful taste of mango, you can make it stronger by adding more tea bags if strong is your preference. Add a little honey and its delicious. Had neighbors try it and they fell in love, drank my whole stash. One of my spouse's favorites, even I enjoy it and I'm a coffee drinker!"
497,This is one of my favorite coffee flavors. Any suggestions would be to make it a little stronger. Someone recently broke into my house and took my Mocha Nut Fudge. Needless to say I was not very happy. I bought this 2 pack so I hopefully won't run out very soon.
498,Best vanilla beans I have ever purchased! I used these beans for butter cream icing and the compliments were endless. Very happy with my purchase and the shipping was extraordinarily fast! Will definitely purchase again.
499,"I purchased this for a shared ""coffee mess.""  We have been using it for the last two weeks and everyone likes it.  It's flavorful and goes well with unflavored light/smooth bodied coffees.  Bold/bitter coffees tend to over-power the mint flavor.<br /><br />  The pump feature does not leak after you use it.  We were expecting to have little drips from it and placed a cup to catch them, but it has not been sullied yet.  Very well designed.  If your preference is for liquid creamer over powdered this is the way to go, especially if you do not have access to refrigeration."
500,Do you like to munch on some popcorn while watching a movie at home?  Do you like serious heat in your food (i.e. Dave's insanity sauce)?  Then you'll love this spicy popcorn.<br /><br />Just be sure to share this with other people who can handle the heat.  It'd certainly be a waste to toss half a bag of this popcorn.
501,"So, I am a peanut butter fiend - I admit it!  However, I am very health conscious, and I realize I can't eat peanut butter all day and stay thin. However, you really could eat PB2 all day and still successfully watch your weight.  This stuff is remarkably good, and I've tried just about everything out there in terms of lower calorie peanut butter substitutes.  I absolutely crave this stuff - So, if you love your PB&J but don't want to trade in for a larger pair of pants, then PB2 is the way to go.  It really does taste great.  When it comes in these 16 oz. bags like this, they're a bit messy. Powder seems to get everywhere.  I usually pour them into a large zip-lock bag (but a canister would be even better) to scoop out what I want, when I want it. Just a little tip there."
502,"Silica is a trace mineral that strengthens the body's connective tissues - muscles, tendons, hair, ligaments, nails, cartilage, and bone - and is vital for healthy skin. Silica deficiency can result in reduced skin elasticity and can hamper the body's ability to heal wounds. Food sources of silica include MILLET, leeks, green beans, garbanzo beans, strawberries, cucumber, mango, celery, asparagus and rhubarb. In its natural form, silica is found in the horsetail herb.<br /><br />Eden is one of my favorite companies to purchase from.  They care so much about making the highest quality products for their customers with complete transparency.  There site offers complete information about their products such as on this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXYZ4M"">EDEN Millet, Whole Grain,16 -Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)</a> it eden gives the following labels/tags: gluten-free, wheat-free, kosher, organic, low fat, low sodium, antioxidants, fiber,macrobiotic, and NON-GMO VERIFIED!  They also give the following nutrition facts on millet:<br /><br />According to the FDA ""Diets rich in whole grain and other plant foods, and low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers."" Also, ""Low fat diets rich in fiber-containing grain products, fruits, and vegetables may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors."" EDEN Organic Millet is low fat, contains no saturated fat or cholesterol, a good source of fiber, protein, thiamin B1, and magnesium, and an excellent source of manganese. It is also a complete protein source containing all essential amino acids. Gluten Free. 100% whole grain.<br /><br />Millet is extremely versatile whole grain. Determined by the amount of water used in cooking, it can be light and fluffy or soft and creamy. EDEN Organic Millet is delicious plain, with fresh or dried fruit, or with sweet vegetables such as winter squash and sweet corn. Serve it as porridge and as a main grain for lunch or dinner. Millet tastes great with just about any condiment such as EDEN Organic Gomasio, EDEN Shake, and EDEN Dulse Flakes, or with roasted seeds or nuts. For best results and to impart a nuttier flavor and fluffier texture, dry roast the washed millet in a cast iron or heavy skillet, over a medium-low flame, stirring constantly until golden, and then cook according to package directions. It is deliciously creamy and soothing in soups and stews, and can be used to make grain burgers, croquettes, salads, and in desserts, whole grain muffins, breads, pancakes and waffles. It makes awesome millet mashed potatoes; just cook millet with cauliflower and mash. You can even use it to make stuffing for squash and cabbage rolls.<br /><br />Millet tastes great sweet or savory.  Add some cinnamon and maple syrup for breakfast.  OR throw some into whatever sweet or savory soup you are creating.  Throw some in your coffee grinder to make fresh millet flour.  Since millet's natural flavor is so mild, you can do with it just about anything and it just tastes great adding nutrition and giving you a great source of silica."
503,"My husband is the ultimate food snob and I would find him crunching on these biscotti all the time.  Also my daughter would pack these in her lunch, they are not too hard, so you don't have to dip them into coffee, they are perfect."
504,"Not sure about the ""thin"" issue but these bars are very tasty for those necessary ""snack"" times.  I do find it difficult to eat just one because they taste GREAT!!!!<br />Definitely try these!"
505,"We love Horizon organic milk (and pretty much all their products)!  My kids love all flavors of this milk, including the regular ol' white milk.  They tell me they know when they are not drinking Horizon milk by the taste, like at school.  Due to the higher sugar content in the flavored milks (vanilla, strawberry and chocolate), I usually water down these flavors with white milk a litte in their cups at home.  They don't seem to care either way and drink all their milk at meals without being nagged.  We love the convenience of being able to toss these packages in the cooler too for road trips or take a stock pile without keeping in a cooler for longer trips.<br /><br />A few important tips, make sure you shake well before opening and serving; and if you want to keep the milk for being squeezed out when little hands are holding, raise the flaps on either side of the package before poking the straw through the top and handing over to the child.  I learned this from a pre-school teacher with juice boxes and it works well for these milk packages also."
506,"Here are the ingredients, which are not listed above :<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />black beans, black-eyes peas, pearly barley and navy beans"
507,"i drink a ton of fluids each day - easily a couple gallons - so it's important that i drink something without lots of calories, sugar, AND caffeine. normally, that would mean to a fairly flavorless drink which is the next part which matters most to me.  well this tea has been the answer to ALL of that!!<br /><br />i was getting this in bulk at the wholesale club when i lived on the east coast but haven't been able to find it bulk since i moved to the west coast so far.  just found it here on amazon and signed up for the subscription...cheaper than buying in the store, and it's delivered right to my door each month for free - how can you beat that?<br /><br />(i am not affiliated in any way with amazon or lipton)"
508,These are excellent cookies without High Fructose Corn Syrup. Very real vanilla flavor with just the right amount of sweetness. They taste a lot like the Trader Joe's Vanilla Wafers but without any butter.
509,"I can't imagine a cup of coffee without this delicious syrup added to it - calorie and sugar free too! It starts, middles and finishes my day!"
510,"I am trying to take off a few pounds, and have started to keep a food log, which requires that I have know how many calories are in each meal and plan my meals in advance. One of my standbys for breakfast is Quaker Instant Oatmeal, which I eat five mornings a week. Breakfast consists of two packets of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, which is 320 calories and a good percentage of my carb intake for the day. Add a little soy milk and some real maple syrup, and this keeps me satisfied until lunchtime at about 400 calories. The oatmeal is has a benefit to cholesterol management, as well providing some carbs for fuel for the morning. I've tried several brands, and the Quaker has always had a more substantial ""feel"" to it, sort of like ""real"" oatmeal. The budget brands have always had a tendency to ""clump up"" onme, for some reason. I don't just recommend it, I like the stuff!<br /><br />Also check out the high fiber version: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JXLZG"">Quaker Oatmeal Instant Oatmeal High Fiber Maple & Brown Sugar 12.6 Oz - 12 Pack</a>."
511,"Yes, this is ""the"" sauce and not only for the heat, but for the feeling of it. It is very tasty, unique, very hot and lives up to its fame. on the bottle it says ""feel alive"" and i tell you, after you have tasted it you feel happy, relaxed, amazing sensations. Really, I'm not joking. I consume very hot sauces daily but i have never had such a rush. WOW!!!!"
512,This is a really good tea.  I am drinking it during my pregnancy to tone the uterus.  Very good taste!
513,"I first read about these bars in a magazine article written by a personal trainer.  She stated that she always keeps one in her travel bag or purse in case of emergencies.  Then when I read the reviews on Amazon I just wasn't sure what to do.  I purchased a single bar from my local health food store and fell in love.  That's when I decided to make a bulk purchase here.<br /><br />I have tried all of the flavors in this package as well as the creamy peanut butter.  They are not only healthy but also delicious!  I do not require a gluten free diet but have tried other gluten free bars and have not been satisfied.  These taste incredible!  I have even used a bar to satisfy my sweet tooth!<br /><br />What I normally look for in a protein bar is the ratio of protein to sugar.  Unfortunately a lot of the higher protein choices out there also contain high amounts of sugar.  Not these.  At 20g of protein (a lot higher than the average bar) and 0g of sugar, you simply cannot lose.<br /><br />Finally I would like to mention that several users seemed to have given a low rating simply because of the image presented.  Perhaps that should be changed but I had no problem noticing the fact that some of the bars were the 100 calorie, thinkThin bites (which I find to be the perfect snack) while some were the full size bars.  This is clear in the image.<br /><br />My bottom line:  I HIGHLY recommend thinkThin bars."
514,"Guys, if you are tired of the traditional ""wife gifts"", try giving this delicious assortment to her....for no reason at all...besides, who do you think gets to share it.  Couple this wonderful sampler with some fresh grapes, fine olives, ""Carr's"" Table Water Crackers, Boars Head Sopressata...and of course (2) bottles of New Zealand's Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc....let's just say you'll have an evening to remember....Oh yes, don't forget the background music!  Cheeses were fresh, top quality, and with the complementing sides, a portion that would (if you wanted to) serve 4-6 people easily."
515,"This is a great find for our family. First off, mixed vegetables is one of the best flavors of baby food. Its also sometimes hard to find in the stores near me that typically have a very meager selection. This eight pack takes care of our needs for a while, and everything comes neatly shipped in a compact little box that you can tear the top of and keep them all together. Every tub arrived and it had a really long expiration date. You cant go wrong!"
516,this was the most awful tasting product i have ever eaten.  i fed it to my cats and they wouldn't eat it.
517,"I love this tea!  If you like peach flavored teas, you'll probably like it.  Good amount of peach flavor.  Mild overall - not strong like black and not grassy like green.  Now and then I try other brands but end up always coming back to Stash.  Their blends/flavors are always my favorites - especially their Earl Grey."
518,"My daughter is 10 months old and she almost choked yesterday when trying these cookies. She had been chewing for less than five minutes when a big piece broke and got stuck in her palate. We were able to retrieve it but it was scary and VERY dangerous. The first box I got at Whole Foods contained several cookies that had broken into pieces, I should have known better. Do not use this product if you have a young baby as it is extremely dangerous."
519,"My cat has ""problems"" with TONS of other cat foods - this is the only kind that agrees with him!"
520,"I have been a long time fan of Crystal Liight's Green Tea with Natural honey and lemon; for some reason I have not been able to find it in stores for 3 or 4 months. Surprised to find this product available...please note the word ""natural"" is missing from the product title. It doesn't taste bad but is more influenced by the honey and lemon as was the original. This will have to do I guess; presume I will get used to it."
521,"My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae."
522,We sent this as a Christmas gift but heard such rave reviews that I'm going to have to get myself some to try.  We were warned that the blue is very strong and this was from someone who really enjoys a strong blue cheese.  He advised to use it very sparingly!  Very happy with this purchase!
523,These crackers are slightly sweet and are my absolute favorite.  They're hard to find in our area so this case price can't be beat!
524,"Bob's Red Mill Red Lentils are delicious.  They are very different from regular brown lentils, with a lighter, less earthy flavor.  Red lentils do not require any soaking, just rinse.  High in fiber, they are superb in soups and appealing to children as well as adults.  I highly recommend an easy Moroccan type red lentil soup with lots of fresh lemon.  Google for recipes.  Or  Simply chop one onion and saute quickly in olive oil,  add plenty of chicken or vegetable broth, a can of diced tomatoes (or chopped fresh), perhaps some chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley and juice from several lemons (I make the entire lentil bag at once because the soup goes fast in my house).  The soup cooks on the stovetop in only an hour or so.  Warm and tasty in winter, light and citrusy  enough for summer.  Red lentils freeze well.  Fabulous healthy vegetarian meal served with whole grain crusty bread.  Comfort food at its best.  Try them!"
525,"This brought me back to my childhood. My dad would always take us kids to the grocery store and buy us each a squeeze pop! There were so good and so easy to eat. My mom would be so upset that he bought them for us because they were also so sticky and boy did we make things sticky. I was so excited when i purchases these because while they do still sell squeeze pops in the stores, they only sell the sour variety now and it's just not the same. I don't like the sour ones, i'd wander through the aisles hoping that just maybe they would be stocked with the original version, but to no avail. I am very pleased that I now know where I can get some! :D"
526,"Initially an overproducer, I was horrified when a mistake by my doctor in prescribing me the wrong birth control caused a dramatic drop in my supply where I wasn't even close to keeping up with my son while he was away at daycare. My lactation consultant recommended this tea to me and I ordered it right away. Earlier this week, I was pumping at best half of what I had previously pumped and we had started tapping into my freezer stash, which was scary to me. By Wednesday the tea had arrived and I immediately started drinking it. Thursday was my lowest day ever, I was able to pump only 6 oz total all day long and I was so discouraged. This morning I woke up with my breasts feeling very full like they had before my supply began to reduce and I just completed my first pumping session and was able to pump about a half ounce MORE than I typically pump! I drank the tea 3 times on Wednesday and 5 times on Thursday. Once I feel like my supply has completely regenerated, I will probably reduce the tea to 2 or 3 times a day, but this tea is amazing! What started out as a terrible and scary week (giving up breastfeeding was a very sad thought) has ended on a high note!"
527,"Yip Yap has always been a favorite treat of my pets.  I have finally come across a dog that hesitantly eats them.  I also noticed a very strong odor when you open the tin.  I am giving most of them away.  The formula is not as good as it once was, and if they are not eaten, the dogs do not see them as a reward."
528,"This is a wonderful coffee, and it works perfectly in my Keurig Platinum. There is no noticeable residue in my coffee cup, and the flavor is excellent. I recommend storing the unused 'pods' in a resealable storage bad to maintain their freshness."
529,"This salt is great and way cheaper than any of the local spice shops. It does seem more difficult to grind than other himilayan salts I have tried, but doing a little at a time makes it well worth it. Would i buy it again?? YES"
530,"With a promotional discount, I reluctantly decided to try Via.  It is still instant coffee and little better than any other instant coffee on the market, which is to say, it's disgusting.  Personally, I will just do without rather than subject myself to the inferior qualities of this product.  One still needs hot water to make instant coffee, and with hot water one can use a small french press or Coghlans One Cup Coffee Filters or Melitta U S A Inc 640007 Perfect Brew Filter Cone.  Don't lower your standards folks!"
531,"I've always loved this cereal, but it hasn't always been available in the various places I have lived.  From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy.  But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals.  It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for ""healthy"" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats.  And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any, but not so much that I feel like I'm having dessert for breakfast.  Great stuff."
532,"I wouldn't recommend this product as after each use it drips constantly. You will end up losing too much of your syrups if you use this. If you don't mind it dripping and wasting most of your syrups, then it will serve its purpose."
533,"I've used stevia for a few years, and I really like this product as the only other ingredient is xylitol which is supposed to help prevent tooth decay.  It's also a bargain compared to individual packets."
534,"For all the hype these Leonard Mountain dry soups have gotten, they sure did disappoint. I have made 6 varieties now (sitting here with a bowl of the Chicken Pasta as I type), and they were consistently bad...even though I followed the package directions EXACTLY. Maybe that was the problem - I followed the package directions. None were done in 20 minutes. (""edible"" in 20 minutes - yes; worth paying xx dollars for it - no; worth calling it ""gourmet"" - no.) And one reviewer called the veggies ""chunky"" - really? Wonder what kind of soup they're used to if they think these soups are chunky.<br /><br />My advice: Lipton instant soup will give you just about the same salty, overseasoned experience as these Leonard Mountain mixes, but for a lot cheaper. Of course, Liption instant soup doesn't purport to call itself ""gourmet"" like LM does.<br /><br />My real advice: Want a ""real"" soup that REALLY only takes 20 minutes? Throw some stock (canned broth will work too) in a pot and let it boil, then toss in some fresh veggies (frozen if you want), pre-cooked meat (or raw shrimp), pasta if you want it, canned beans if you want them, and cook until the veggies are the way you like them. Season to taste with just salt and pepper, or add garlic and/or onion powder. Green herbs are great too if you know how to use them.<br /><br />If you're using a crockpot (which I do all the time), do the same thing except wait until the last 30 minutes to toss in the pre-cooked meat. You could also get away with dried beans in a crockpot.<br /><br />In any case, fresh soup only takes 20 minutes to begin with, so these LM soups aren't saving anyone any time.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy these again. EVER. If I need convenience, I'd rather buy canned soup than these."
535,"I gave ""Pica Limon Candy"" to my sister for her birthday. She used to eat it when she was a kid. She gave it thumbs up. I bought this candy at Amazon.com  Nobody else carries it. Its reasonably priced."
536,Really there is something special with this coffee ..<br />What intrigued me is to raise prices of coffee in the Amazon?
537,The mix helps a lot during workouts although this might be a subjective judgment. I definitely would order this mix when I finish this pack and consider other products by this company.
538,"I picked up a box of this coffee at Wal-Mart.  Thought the K-cups felt rather light when I put one in my machine.  The second it started brewing I knew by the smell it was instant.  I felt extremely ripped off!  The Keurig coffeemaker brews coffee ""instantly"" so why would anyone put instant coffee in a K-cup?? I called the company and they said Grove Square was not authorized to make coffee for them.  I returned the box to Wal Mart for a full refund.  I noticed the last time I was at Wal Mart, that they are only selling this brand and the new ""iced coffee"" K-cups.  I wouldn't buy another K-cup from Wal Mart.  They don't carry any of the popular coffee brands and why wouold they continue to carry this inferior coffee?"
539,These crackers are really good and thanks to Amazon's Subscribe & Save program I can get them at a really good price.  You can't get Ryvita at most U.S. grocers.  You have to go all the way to Whole Foods and pay a premium price.  They're fat free too and have a decent amount of fiber!  Great snack if you follow a sattvic diet.
540,Being an elite cyclist and always looking for healthy nutrition that tastes great I have tried a lot of bars. Larabar have become my only choice for a snackbar while riding. They are great tasting soft and easy to chew while riding. Best of all they are not loaded with any artificial crap or fillers.
541,"These bars have a nice hit of dark chocolate without it being overpowering or bitter. Another nice point is that they are fairly soft and chewy. Most of the granola bars I've tried in the past have been either hard and dry with sharp bits that just never feel good in the mouth, or their softness is at the expense of being gummy and too sweet. These were very well balanced. The bars were also just a bit smaller than the average bars, or at least they felt it, and that was a good thing, too. They were more than enough to satisfy that sweet craving without being heavy or too filling."
542,it is a really great product. it helps me stick to my diet. just run water over the noodles and your good to go. you can put them in anything you want. definitely worth the try. they can be hard to cut with your fork so make sure you cut them up with a knife or kitchen scissors before you put them in whatever dish your making.
543,"I loved the taste of the Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar. It had just the right amount of sweetness. The problem is that it is also very high in sugar. 16g of sugar per tablespoon, which add up to 60 calories a serving, is pretty high.I would have given it 5 stars if not for the high sugar content.I am trying to lose weight, and I gained using the Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar. So I had to go back to using Truvia sweetner for my coffee, tea, etc.<br /><br />If I had not been trying to lose weight, I would still be using it. It taste great and is a very wholesome sweetner, and better for you than refined sugar."
544,"First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.<br />I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack?"
545,"Got this aft learning the main ingredient for lemishine,  I add a little of this to my dishwasher with the detergent in each wash and the dishes come out sparking. No more white calcium film.  And sooo much betterr price than all the products out there!"
546,These jelly beans are great...the taste is better than most stuff on the market and they have electrolytes in them as well as carbs.  Same carb as a GU but i like the fact that you eat them as you go along. Highly recommended..haven't tried any other flavors but i bet they are all GREAT.  PS. check out Cliff Shot Blocks for a good steady carb delevery too.
547,I use these for house breaking.  Works great.  Even now that the girls are a few years old the go out first thing in the morning and then go to where the treats are and wait for their reward.
548,"After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due."
549,"Can't go wrong with pop-tarts, especially with the discount that was being offered at the time!"
550,"This popcorn totally  refused to pop. No matter what way we tried to pop this popping corn, it was a total  failure.I would not only NOT EVER  recomend it to a friend, I would go out of my way  to warn them to  not to waste their money.It ended up in the garbage."
551,"This is by far the absolute worst tasting ""Thai"" spice I have ever used. I have been to Thailand numerous times and this is nothing like Thai seasoning. The taste is bland, although a bit spicy. This would best be used as something you might put on a salad as an accent.<br /><br />This being said, I have also tried The Spice Hunter Jerk Seasoning and it too is awful. Maybe it's because Spice Hunter seasonings are salt free... There's a reason why store shelves are stocked with name-brand products, because they are good. This brand is harder to find and there's a reason. I had such high hopes..."
552,"This is a great salami. I don't dig Genoa or any wimpy greasy stuff.<br /><br />This stuff is hard, hearty, and really well spiced up.<br /><br />Cooked or cold, it kicks ass.<br /><br />I would bring this on a boat, camping, or to the workplace.<br /><br />Sliced nice, it would really compliment cheese, crackers, and vino too.<br /><br />No doubt, one serious real deal of value."
553,Excellent GF pancakes - taste very close to the regular kind without that weird dusty taste you get from some of the other mixes. I highly recommend this product for GF pancakes.
554,What can I say... its the best of starburst... Im shamed to say the whole box was gone within a week..lol
555,"After just one bite, I was completely sold on this bar - it is PACKED with pieces of pistachios and cashews, has a sweet (but definitely not overly sweet) flavor from the dates, and has a nice, chewy texture. Overall, a very pleasing experience for my taste buds - all while nourishing my body, as well!<br /><br />Do not let some of the nutritional information (i.e. the fat and sugar contents) scare you - pistachios are an excellent source of protein, Vitamin E, potassium, magnesium, iron, phosphorous, and zinc; the cashews contribute iron and zinc as well, plus heart-healthy oils and Vitamin B6. In addition, the dates are a good source of Vitamins A, C, and B-Complex, plus iron and and magnesium as well. Even though the bar is only 51 grams, it is VERY satisfying and filling.<br /><br />Everything in this bar occurs naturally - no chemicals, artificial ingredients, or trans-fats here! In fact, the bar contains just three ingredients: dates, pistachios, and cashews - no dictionary needed to figure out its contents, that's for sure.<br /><br />When I received my package of the Pistachio Larabars from Amazon, the box was in great condition, and none of the bars (at least, the ones I have eaten so far; and I eat one almost everyday) have been rancid. Overall, this product (and other Larabar flavors, as well) is HIGHLY recommended, on my part."
556,Helped when I had a cold and soar throat and could not make it to the doctor-- I would purchase again
557,"This is the best seasoning money can buy. I bought two and hope it last.It makes steak, pork and burgers mouth watering."
558,"OK, so I know it is salt, but this really was a great buy. I recently got the cooking bug and wanted to look at what different kinds of salt might do for my dishes. I have to say of the salts I have purchased (5 different kidns to date) the black lava salt has been my favorite. To lend additional credence to my review, I can point to my housemate who has also fallen in love with this salt.<br /><br />Pros: Amazing taste<br /><br />COns: It is salt and it is not cheap when you factor in teh price and shipping. That said, I would buy this again."
559,"The can says no beans. One of the central ingredients of this dish is ""vegetable protein,"" which contains soy flour. Soy is a bean. Therefore there are beans. Stop misleading these poor people who think this sludge is a no-bean delicacy!"
560,"These cookies are very close to the Archway molasses cookies.  They have a very sharp bite of ginger to them, followed by a mellow molasses taste. These are the first GF cookies I have found where I can not tell they are GF. This company makes a chocolate chip <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXC3Q"">Kinnikinnick Foods Gluten-Free Cookies, Montana's Chocolate Chip, 8-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a> that taste like inexpensive store bought choc-chip cookies, not my preference, but not bad at all.  Theses run about $4 each in the store at best, making this a great deal, but the expiration date is not to far out so be aware."
561,"Been trying to get away from soda the past couple of months and was looking for something to ""liven up"" my water, so I decided to order a couple of these.  This product did just that: a great taste with very little calories."
562,"I bought these for my special needs son so that he could have a variety of flavors.  We can only buy the vanilla and chocolate in stores, but no one carries the strawberry.  Unfortunately, he is not crazy about this flavor, but I have no problem drinking it myself.  I really like the taste and since I do not usually eat well as I should, this is a great idea to get in much needed vitamins and minerals once a day!  Highly recommended!"
563,I really like this coffee it has a smooth taste to it.  I also like the ability to buy in bulk so that I don't run out so often.
564,Delicious and came much faster than it was supposed to!  Very pleasant surprise!
565,All you sardine lovers these are by far the best I have ever tasted.  Whether you like them with lemon or with mayo I cannot express the taste of this wonderful sardine and oh so good for you
566,"I buy this for my husband & also as an occasional treat for my older kids. Since we are a family of 6, the Keurig is not exactly economical. However, since I found these cappuccino k-cups, it makes it much easier to fit in our budget. And they love the flavor! The French Vanilla ones are great too!"
567,"The white tea rub for lamb adds a very nice flavor to our lamb meals.<br /><br />However I ordered 3, 5 oz cans of lamb rub and only recieved 1 with 2 other cans of chicken rub in the package.  Although I also enjoy the chicken rub I had, at the same time, ordered 3 cans of it.  So I ended up with 5 cans of the chicken rub and only one can of the lamb rub.<br /><br />I emailed Amazon about this error but never got a reply.<br /><br />Garland Stamper"
568,"We've purchased dragonwell green tea from other vendors and the quality has been much better.  Of course we paid quite a bit more for it as well.  This just goes to prove ""you get what you pay for"". This bag has a lot of stems and other debris, so would not recommend.  Pay the higher price and get the better quality tea."
569,I love my keurig and this is one of my favorite flavors. I can taste and smell the chocolate and raspberry in it. Pair it with a good creamer and you have a lovely cup of coffee. It's just heaven to have my keurig and have differnt flavors!
570,"I was wary purchasing the variety pack after reading/seeing the pictures associated with the product. However, I just received mine and I was very happy to see that each variety pack I ordered was in its own separate box and the variety provided was exactly as pictured. I would urge anyone considering buying the variety packs from crazy cups to do so! I am very happy with it and I can't wait to try the flavors with my new keurig! Dont be discouraged by the old negative reviews."
571,"My sister tried these out with one of her  dogs.  She says:<br /><br />I gave the stick a try with our small rat terrier mix, Nellie.  At first I couldn't figure out how to open it the bottle.  It looked like you pealed the wrapper off the lid area, but it wasn't coming.  Then I could see the faint perforated line around the base of the cap and you twist to break that, like a salad dressing bottle.  The stick itself is like a deodorant roll-on. Seriously.  The instructions say to shake it up before offering.  This stick was a ""chicken flavor"".  I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.  If you put it up close to you, it is strong, so I just kept it down at dog level.<br /><br />This is a very odd way to give a treat to a dog. But, I don't think Nellie noticed, she was too busy enjoying it."
572,"This stuff is amazing.  Somewhat healthy and tastes like a chocolate shake.  Recommend buying if you like coconut.  Shake it up good, though."
573,"i'm not a real fan of instant coffee as i prefer the fresh ground stuff, but sometimes one has to settle for convience.  this is pretty good instant coffee.  about 60 servings per jar.  it is pleasant tasting.  to get an extra boost, i put a little of this coffee in with a packet of ginseng coffee and that gets me the lift i need for the morning.  either way, enjoy!"
574,"I LOVE lemon - the color, the taste, everything.  And True Lemon is SOOOO yummy!  In this crystalized form it doesn't change the consistancy of what you put it in.  Lemon juice can do that, depending on how much you use.  I first tried it in the little packets and I realized that form was not enough.  So I bought these large caontainers.  So good - I especially like to add it to vanilla yogurt....now I'm getting hungry...."
575,"The new Stevia sweetener ruined this, formerly my favorite drink by far. Cannot choke this new stuff down. I won't be buying it anymore until they change back to the old formula."
576,"I had a bate and switch puled on me! with NO returns  Thanx Amazon, I ordered 3 cases one type of cat food, ocean whitefish & tuna dinner you sent me a verarity pack of three different cases and types of friskies dinners SO bank the money and eat shit.<br />George"
577,When I purchased this I wasn't concerned about not being a traditional k cup and I was looking for a cheaper bold coffee. This just doesn't do it. It's a medium at best and not very consistant from pod to pod. I won't be purchashing this again..
578,This is my favorite coffee and I cannot get it where I live. I am thrilled to find this provider !! I get it for a great price and it comes automatically each month. I highly recommend them !! A++++
579,"These are very tasty bars.  They have enough dried berries to taste, and I usually get at least one with every bite.  It is a sweet bar, kind of like a Rice Krispie Treat, but not quite as sticky.  They're soft and stay fresh for a long time, too.<br /><br />I love the organic ingredients, always feel good about eating foods without synthetic pesticides or other crap like that.<br /><br />These bars don't have high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, so right there tells you they're worth the cost.  They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose, so if you have a fructose intolerance, use caution because of that ingredient.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, especially for those on a gluten-free diet."
580,"I used to purchase this coffee blend at BJ's Wholesale when I lived outside of Boston. Hadn't found it locally when I moved away, then discovered I could get it through Amazon. Hurray! So mild & mellow, just enough hint of Kona to make it worthwhile. Compared to supermarket coffee this is miles ahead in smoothness. Caveat: I spent a year in Hawai'i & had real, 100% Kona coffee, which this product makes no pretensions at being. But for the price, you wouldn't have expected 100% Kona, would you? I'm just pleased as punch that I can keep my coffee jar stocked without breaking the bank or resorting to bitter-tasting supermarket coffee."
581,"This syrup certainly isn't a traditional blueberry syrup.  It is a bit too sweet so a little goes a very long way.  Since I have been off regular sugar and corn syrups for years, I enjoyed it quite a bit."
582,"This is the first time trying this brand. These taste so good and they are good for you, which is even better. Can't wait to try other flavors!"
583,"I have a Jura Capresso automatic espresso machine.  I like it, but I have found it difficult to find beans that make expresso that takes much like what you might get at a Starbucks.  The beans have to be very robust, but they can't be French or Italian roasted because that makes them too oily (which can clog the machine).  I've tried lots and lots of different beans, some quite expensive (like more than $20 / lb.).  I saw these at Costco and decided to give them a try.  They are perfect.  The flavor is great, and the roast is pretty dry so they work beautifully in my machine."
584,"Looking hard for pomegranate flavor, it was really hard for me to find one in these Mexican made twists. They are just like ordinary licorice twists, that are somewhat sticky, and exorbitantly priced for only ""70% organic"". Carbohydrate content is 11% in these twists, so these are definitely not healthy. But using ""organic"" sugar  gives them the excuse to charge preposterous price."
585,This is a excellent product with mild seasoning to give flavor to chicken in Mexican style cooking.  I use to simmer chicken breasts to shred for enchiladas and for diced chicken for tacos and nachos.
586,This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.
587,I thought I had ordered a chicken and beef mixture but got seafood.  Not sure if the mistake was mine or the distributors.  The cat food did arrive relatively promptly and is as expected.  My cat likes it.
588,"I mainly bought this because my son has fairly bad ADHD and I wanted to try more natural routes before things like medication. I am not sure it helps him that much at all, but I know it does help me calm down enough to get sleep when I remember to take it. Which is good, because my insomnia was driving me absolutely nuts!<br />I have to get more 100% cranberry juice, because I prefer this mixed in with juice than I do with water."
589,"Excellent coffee for people on a tight schedule. My Fiancee fell in love with my brother in law's and had to have one! Now, everyone that visits our house has to try a cup and keeps coming back for more. Also like the fact that there's a wide variety of coffee flavors to choose from."
590,"I've tried lots of different protein bars over the years and these are by far the tastiest (Triple Choc is the best in my opinion) - I actually look forward to eating these things!  I sometimes eat one of these in place of lunch or as a snack in the late morning and middle of the day (half in the mid-morning, half after lunch).<br /><br />The bars are relatively low-cal and have a decent amount of protein which, per their packaging, is more easily absorbed than other protein supplements.  I can't speak to their science but the bars seem to be working for me . . . I've lost around 10 lbs over the past month and put on a lot of muscle.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good protein bar, look no further."
591,"I have a basenji dog that is a bit ""picky"" and will not eat some dog foods (I have tried several of the ""premium"" and ""super-premium"" dog foods.<br /><br />He loves several of the Cesar Canine Cuisine foods and this is one of his favorites.  There is never any hesitation when I put his food down, he digs right in and consumes it almost instantly.<br /><br />There have been no GI upsets with this food - his stools are completely normal.  Traveling with him is easy with this food because it doesn't require refrigeration and no mixing - although I do give him dry food to ""snack on"" at will, he usually eats only a small amount of this and only when he has been very active.<br /><br />He gets two packages a day, one in the morning, one in the evening so a pack of 24 lasts 12 days."
592,"2 out of 3 of out cats love them. As far as finicky cats go, I consider that a success. They've only been enjoying them for a few days, but so far they haven't caused any vomiting as many of the other treats tend to do."
593,"This is by far my favorite K-cup.I like my coffee strong, and this does the trick! It has a very smooth flavor with no bitter after taste. 5 Stars!"
594,"I have a very picky 7 yr old. His new food kick is granola. All kinds.... plain, with milk, in his yogurt. Chocolate is his favorite thing so when I saw this I had to buy some (already had other Bare Naked granola so know its GOOD stuff) Its a HUGE hit!! I try to limit his candy & chocolate but this will be a nice treat for him, he loves it and its better for him than candy!!"
595,"I got hooked on these pineapples years ago when you could buy them at the Wal-Mart. Now, I can't find them there so I checked on Amazon to see if they sold them. They are delicious with coffee. I will continue buying this product. They are shipped on time and in resealable bags."
596,This brand has a wide variety of flavors.  This makes a great gift or when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth.
597,We have tried a number of decaf k-cups and have found a lot of them to be bitter. Not so with this one - it comes highly recommended!
598,"This is one my favorite black teas.  It isn't sweet or too spicy like many orange teas, which is why I like it so much.  We moved from Oregon to Pennsylvania and I couldn't find it in my local grocery stores, so I was happy i could order it online."
599,Clean tasting cookies. Just wish they can make it a little less sweet. Much better tasting and superior ingredients than regular cookies like Oreo. You can feel the difference in every bite.
600,"Can find the 7 oz bottle online at many other retailers for about 1/2 the cost of this.  I would search elsewhere for this treat.  My dog loves them, but not at this price."
601,"These cookies are great for kids on the GFCF diet. My daughter loved them. They are a bit pricey, but taste great.<br /><br />The cookies are a little on the light & airy side.. but the chips are yummy... the taste is good. They arent your regular chocolate chip cookies, but they will make the grade with the kids ;)"
602,"I loved vitalabs egg protein, but I think their out of business.  This healthy n fit will substitute just fine,"
603,We have a family in our church that are gluten intolerant and therefore can't use regular bread for Communion.  This bread mix is great for this and does not make the family feel different from everyone else. The mix is super easy to fix and makes a great loaf of tasty bread.  So glad we found it!
604,"We love Yogi Tea,  and we drink many flavors from it,  but this tea is very good as well,  and love the Chamomile/Spearmint combination in one.<br />Worth to try!!!"
605,"Great Product, these are my Chihuahuas favorite treat.  I have never had any problems with them except the bucket runs out to fast."
606,"A review for cookies?  Why not?<br /><br />My wife and I love Oreos.  Every once in a while she picks up a bag at the store and we eat some with milk.<br /><br />The problem is that we feel compelled to finish off the bag before they get stale.  Since all the kids are gone that's tough.  It's not really good for us and after 3 or 4 nights it gets kind of old.<br /><br />Recently she got a 12 pack assortment of cookies which contained Oreos, Nutter Butters, etc.  I wondered if there was a way to just buy a whole bunch of ""snack packs"" for Oreos and sure enough Amazon has them.<br /><br />Now we can have that 6 cookie ""fix"" without having to remember to pick them up at the store or worry about them going stale if we don't finish them off."
607,"I do not find this tea to be overly sweet and I take it hot or cold without any sweetener. I prefer it hot I find, but have tried it iced and found it to be quite pleasant.  This tea has a lightly fruity taste.  There are many ingredients, which I have found to be true of all of Stash's herbal teas.  To fear the ingredients, they are all top quality and marry well.  I wondered what ""goji berry flavor"" was and contacted the company.  Here is a transcript:<br /><br />Email reply from Stash when asked about goji berry flavor:<br /><br />Unfortunately it's proprietary information with our suppliers; however we do require natural statements from our suppliers. We use the Code of Federal Regulations as far as our definition of natural<br /><br />According to the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR), the term natural flavor means ""the essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive,  protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juices, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible years, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in t food is flavoring rather than nutritional.""<br /><br />There you have it, essential oil of goji berry.  Not so mysterious after all.  I recommend getting the superfruit sampler where you get to try this flavor and five others.  I have found them all to be outstanding and go back for more all the time."
608,"This tea is not Sencha. Don't use Japanease name. This tea have tea stem,and big reaf. Have you ever sea the Japanease tea befor?<br />It doesn't like this.This tea doesn't have fregrance at all.I don't recomend this tea for anybody.It's so sad because I like Tea forte.<br />they ashame this tea,sorry."
609,"My Shih-Tzu had some metabolism issues and it was the vet who recommended this brand and formula. She has done so well on Wellness.<br /><br />Her stools are no longer unformed and soft. She likes the taste even without ""condiments"", wet food.<br /><br />She is now regular in her bowel movements and also in her normal weight for age.<br /><br />It's somewhat pricey, but pets have requirements just as people do and her overall health has improved significantly and I'm a big fan now.<br /><br />I don't ever intend to switch brands unless indicated by her vet."
610,"Fast delivery, great product!  Exactly what I wanted and cannot find locally.  Will continue to purchase from Parthenon Foods with confidence. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LRH7C6"">Gyro Meat (SLICED) approx. 1lb</a>"
611,"I was pretty disappointed with the Red Strawberry Banana Fruit Jell Slices, way to much sugar on the outside, the jelly part seems more crumbly then jelly like, really not much strawberry banana taste. 2 stars are for freshness and quantity."
612,"Like the title says. There just aren't that many nuts. The picture shows a good amount of almonds,peanuts and cranberry. But the bars are mostly made of oats w/ high maltose corn syrup......Whatever that is. But those are really the first 2 ingredients. Other wise it's actually a pretty good bar. Probably not as healthy as a kind bar. But a lot cheaper. If you have sam's club member ship look into buying these there. You can get a pack of 30- 1.2 oz bars for  $10."
613,"re:  Lifesaver Hawaiian Fruits Hard Candy 6.26 oz. bag<br /><br />My cousin mentioned how much she & her grandkids enjoyed these candies, but the candy was not available in any stores here locally.  My cousin is so helpful to me, taking me to dr's appointments, etc. and she will not accept anything in return, not even taking her out to lunch or dinner, gas money etc.  So when she mentioned not being able to find one of their favorite candies, I decided that I would take on the challenge.  I decided to surprise her with the candy.<br /><br />I searched quite a few of my trusted on-line sites for candies that may not be available locally.  All those sites had the candy listed as a product they normally carry, but they all listed the candy as out of stock.<br /><br />Finally I checked Amazon and they had the elusive Lifesaver Hawaiian Fruits Hard Candy.  My candy order arrived very quickly and in wonderful condition.  I really surprised my cousin when I told her that not only had I found the Hawaiian Fruits Lifesavers, but that I had a dozen bags (minimum amount required per order) for her."
614,"I bought 2 boxes of these bars last Summer and must have gained 20 lbs. cos I only gave away a few.  These bars ARE SCRUMPTIOUS, something about toffee and milk chocolate just makes my mouth water, I like these more than Skor bars because the toffee tastes better, more buttery, sweeter and has a certain crunch to it that Skor bars don't.  Skor's chocolate tastes better cos it's a little darker but the toffee isn't nearly as good.  These things are INSANELY good, I honestly don't know if there are many other chocolate/toffee bars/candies out there, besides Heath, Skor, Almond Roca, Werther's Originals, Reisen's and the like, but there should be.  I can without these for a long time because the butter-to-sugar content of the toffee is so crazy high that I'm sure diabetes would be in my future if I didn't cut back on them.  A worthy gem of a candy."
615,"Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled ""finely ground"".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.  The three stars are only because the salt was not what I would consider finely ground."
616,"Have tried the product from the grocery store and loved it. We had a hard time finding this product in the stores. Since we do grocery shopping once a month we were looking for 6 to 8 and could only find 2 or 3. We looked on line and found a company to purchase from for a reasonable price except they wanted $10 per bottle for shipping, $60 for six bottles, really? We did not know that Amazon also dealt with food products but we search anyway. Not only did we find the product, we found it slightly lower than the store price and FREE SHIPPING! We bought 2 cases and plan to purchase a case a month especially in the summer time when we camp. This is an excellent product which can be altered to your liking. For instance we add Hershey's chocolate syrup into the bottle and make chocolate pancakes."
617,"We have an 11-year-old cat that has been eating Purina salmon and tuna for most of his life.  He has always thrown up food at least 3 times a week and I thought it was just something we had to put up with.  He also began licking his fur completely off his tummy.  After reading many reviews on different cat foods, I tried Blue Buffalo.  He did stop throwing up but he did not like it.  We tried the Taste of the Wild and he loves it.  It may be pricier but he eats less and doesn't throw it up.  I can't tell you how many rolls of paper towels and Resolve carpet cleaner we used to go through with the Purina food.  I think this food will actually save us money in the end."
618,"The only reason I bought this was because I could buy it with a special 50% discount, therefore getting 6 boxes of it at half price of $ 20.80 seemed to be a good deal to me.  How wrong I was!  I was surprised to see its price jumped up to $ 22.15 when I wrote this review (cheaper when buy it via subscribe and save) which comes to about $ 3.69 a box, still cheaper than its price of $ 3.99 (plus sales tax) in my local Target.  However, the problem was when I opened its BIG box up, there were only five tiny packages: a small pack of hummus dip, a small pack of multi-seed crackers, a small pack (0.75 oz) of fruit and nut mix, a small pack of Dry Roasted Edamame and a very tiny (0.43 oz) roast dark 60% cacao organic dark chocolate.  Unless you eat like a bird, there is no way this box can serve as anything but a snack, a very small one.<br /><br />(1) Hummus dip and multi-seed crackers - there is 13 gram of fat (3 gram saturated fat) in the hummus dip, however the biggest problem is its large content of salt (450 gm sodium).  It tasted so salty (bitter) that it completely ruined the taste of the hummus.  If you eat this dip everyday, you would have high blood pressure for sure.  Now the crackers are quite good but there are really only a few of them.<br /><br />(2)Baja Blend fruit nut mix - I was surprised to see it has 5 gm of fat and 9 gm of sugar in such a tiny bag (0.75 oz or 21 gm).  It tastes quite sweet, a little bit tart and wow, spicy HOT! It burned my tongue.  A very strange mix, not too bad but very unusual and I am not sure I want to repeat the experience. I could not figure out where the hot spice comes from even after I read its package repeatedly.<br /><br />(3) Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame - quite healthy, only 150 gm of sodium and 4 gm fat (0.5 gm saturated).  It tasted pretty good but no different than any roasted edamame you can buy yourself.  It would be much cheaper.<br /><br />(4)Chocolate - yes, its is supposed to be organic, but strange enough it will not tell you how much sugar or fat it has.  The chocolate piece's outside is also whitish, to me that may be a sign of the chocolate becomes too old or? How does it taste? It taste like anything but chocolate.  I do not believe I can eat more than a bite of it.<br /><br />Therefore, not trying to bad mouth this product, but why would I want to pay about $ 3.69 to pay for a box of something that is not healthy, not filling, not tasting good unless, well, you want to lose weight.  I believe if you would eat it as your meals everyday, you will be almost guaranteed to lose weight because you would simply discard the whole box before you can finish them and will still feel hungry."
619,Smart Chews are the greatest beneficial non-prescription product to fight against cholesterol on the market today!
620,This is the only chai brand that i've tried so far but it seems to be very good. nicely spiced. not to strong or weak.
621,"The product description calls Kellogg's Sunshine Cheez-IT Mozzarella Cheese, a satisfying snack and claims that ...""regular snacking helps prevent overeating at mealtime and provides children with needed energy to keep their brains and bodies going throughout the day.""<br /><br />Forget regular snacking.  With Cheez-IT Mozzarella it's munching mania.  The snack is like an overly salty bag of potato chips, and everybody knows about the (false) prospects of having ""only"" one.  ""One more"" is the mantra of Cheez-IT Mozzarella.  So incredibly addictive, it is a definite staple for the average American's couch potato stash.<br /><br />Taste wise, although billed as ""100 percent real Mozzarella cheese,"" they have a chemical sting (you know, the one that Americans complain about, but secretly love).  However, the cheesy flavor is distinct, the texture of the cracker ... Cheez-IT ... all the way.  Keep them handy along with the other growing varieties of Cheez-IT crackers for the ultimate binge-snacking escape.<br /><br />Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist<br />Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE"
622,"I inherited my Keurig from my late mother. Store coffee pods seemed too weak. I read the reviews for ""Jet Fuel"" and decided to order 50 pod package. I like a bold coffee but this has a very bitter taste. I'm going to try again, after descaling the coffee maker. If flavor improves, I'll gladly retract my remarks. If not, I won't be buying THIS coffee again.<br />06/27/2012: Descaled Keurig coffee maker. Jet Fuel coffee was STILL too bitter for my taste. Perhaps my taste has changed. Whatever the reason, I WON'T be buying THIS coffee again."
623,If I could only find these locally.  An excellent snack with 0 fat and very few carbohydrates. They are a bit pricey but seem worth your money.
624,"Even though I like Zevia ginger root beer better than this one, I seem to be drinking this up faster than Dr. Zevia, which is my second-favorite dark soda of theirs. (I bought this due to lack of availability of Zevia ginger root beer at a reasonable price.)"
625,"I opened my first pack of Leonidas chocolate to find them completely melted. I thought for certain I was out $40. I skeptically emailed the company through the amazon provided link expecting never to hear back. Not only did I hear back by later that evening, but the next day I had a new package of chocolate in Perfect Condition with no additonal charge. The Chocolate in and of itself is great, but I believe that good customer service, especially in this day and age, should be commended. I would highly recommend both the Chocolate and the company and will be doing business with them again."
626,We've ordered for them every month and only once the package inside the seal had a small hole and wasn't as fresh.
627,"Being a salt-free product is why I purchased this, but the chips are quite greasy."
628,"I've been trying new things I wouldn't ordinarily even think of trying because they're healthy for me. My initial reaction was<br />not so great, but I could deal with eating them because they're good for me.  So days later, had more....okay I could deal with them a little better.<br />Then, days later I realized I was sitting at my computer & just popping them into my mouth & I was REALLY LIKING THEM A LOT.  Only 60 calories for the whole package.  They are flakey, lightly crunchy, & lightly salty in tast.  Sure beats having potato chips.  I went to trader joes & purchased 15 boxes for 99 cents each box just to make sure they're in the house when I get the munchies.<br />Definitely try them & give them a chance..."
629,"These little kits are a treasure--simple to do, and very tasty results.  I can't recommend them more highly.  Wish they were easier to find in supermarkets."
630,I received this tea for Christmas.  This tea has a great flavor and has quickly become my new favorite.
631,"The Senseo pods are very convenient and an easier way to purchase in bulk from Amazon than search in brick and mortar stores.  HOWEVER, as a single user, I would wish for a more varied packaging option, such as one regular cofee, one decaf and two flavored ones, such as Hazelnut and Godiva. This would be convenient and more reasonable for one living on a fixed income.  Please forward this suggestion to the manufacturer."
632,"Although both Sugar Twin and Sweet and Low both use saccharine, Sugar Twin has a much better taste."
633,They should never have brought them back if they had to use whatever chemicals they are using now.  What a waste of money and taste buds.
634,"Caffe Verona is perfect for that pick me up treat after lunch or dinner - - - powerful flavor, strong brew that taste great. T-Disc (Tassimo) makes the perfect cup every time!"
635,"This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice."
636,"I have never rated anything on Amazon before, but I was very impressed by this chili.  I have tried many different canned chilies and have found most of them are like a bland bean soup.  My favorite before trying Wolf's was Amy's vegetarian (and I am NOT a vegetarian) just because it had some flavor.  You can't get any better chili unless you make it yourself."
637,This Earl Grey tea has real oil of bergamot (the flavoring that makes Earl Grey tea taste so good) not flavoring like most other brands. The packages inside are 4 tea bags per foil pack which is less packaging but you should know it's not individual tea bags in individual packs. We have these on subscription so it's not a problem.
638,"These are so good, hard to find in stores, but darned expensive. I get them for a special treat sometimes, there is no better bar, but oooh the price! that stops me from making it a habit."
639,"These are tablets of sodium saccharine, 1 grain per tablet. They're much more convenient to use than the powdered saccharine in the pink packets. If you prefer saccharine as your artificial sweetener of choice, this is an easy way to portion it out."
640,Arrived sooner than the estimate and the item was exactly as pictured. I would definitely purchase this product again. They are impossible to find in my area so I was very glad that this supplier is offering them.
641,"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
642,Always an outstanding product.  Have used Watkins Black Pepper for years and highly recommend it.  Product received in a timely fashion.
643,"There are few things today that have stood the test of time, and still have as much value as this product.  Couldn't believe all of the uses they have on the website.  But, if you have a large pool, this is indispensable.  Pool supply stores kill you with steep prices for their products.  This keeps alkalinity and ph in line, for a fraction of the cost.  Since I've been using it, we saved lots of money.  Word to the wise: try it out."
644,"I read the reviews and then went to store to buy product, I had to see for myself what would happen. We didn't get cramps but got plenty of ammo for use in a fart war against each other. The taste was ok, not great. Would eat again but only a small single slice."
645,"Coffee tastes expresso based -- strong but not bitter. My favorite way of drinking it is with french vanilla creamer. I don't like overly sweet coffee, so no sugar. But the creamer makes it even smoother! Wow! Great coffee!"
646,We timed it. It took my german shorthaired pointer 1 minute 37 seconds his first go around.  Pieces slide to easy sot hey will open up with the first wack of the paw. Anyone know of anything that actually makes the dog work for a treat?
647,"I've been looking to find a new brand, I thus came to Amazon, bought it based on the reviews, and to my surprise, I like it, mind you, if feeding kids, a little sliced up or dried fruit go a long way, as it is slightly bland. A bit pricey given how much you get. But I can see myself sticking with it."
648,"I've been trying different jerkys because my Dukan Diet allows it... Some have way too much sugar content. Thanks, Jack Links, for doing it up right! (3 grams sugar compared to 7+ in other brands.) The peppered flavor is spicy enough to let me know I ate something, but it's not so sweet it comes across like candy. I buy pound bags and divide it into five baggies, or I'd eat the whole bag at once. The meat is pretty clean, compared to other jerky I've had where every other mouthful is unfit for chewing. Best price I've found was through eBay buying in quantity, then dividing the bags myself. That last crumbly handful left in the bottom of the one pound bag is a real eye-opener, as that seems to be where all the pepper seeds congregate. Good Times! P.S. Lost 40 pounds on Dukan Diet in about three months and am very content with the foods I get to eat, jerky being one of them."
649,"My brother loved it while visiting Peru, so naturally I had to get this for his birthday. It was his favorite gift!"
650,"I bought this tea because I love the Thai Ice tea I get at my local Thai restaurant.  Although it taste similar to the tea I love, no matter how many different ways I make it, I still get a nasty after-taste.  Now I'm stuck with 4 bags of tea I dislike.  Hopefully I'll have better luck with a different brand."
651,"These candies are great if they are NOT expired.  I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products.  Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires.  Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them:  Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva.  I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates.  Good luck."
652,"These treats come in small (cat) packages and large (dog) packages.  I save money by buying the dog size for my 5 rescued cats and breaking up the larger pieces.  I have a timed treat feeder that is in use when we are away from home, and this is a big favorite with the group.  Short of fixing them some freshly cooked chicken breast (tough to do when we're not home!), this is one of the healthiest and tastiest treats around."
653,"Makes a reasonably good cup of coffee.Lacks the smoothness of some brands, but those who like a strong brew may like this"
654,"I am doing Weight Watchers, but there are certain foods I did not want to give up.  One was potato chips.  I love the Popchips and they do taste like potato chips unlike other products I have tried.  One serving is 3 points on the WW point system and you can have 18-22 chips, depending on the flavor you choose.  Very good!"
655,"Shipping is so fast, ordered Friday and had Monday via USPS. I love this combo pack... The Ghost pepper is a force to be reckoned with, Chocolate Habanero I love the flover. This is a great value...."
656,wonderful. my first time working with fondant and this stuff made it really easy. plus it tasted pretty good. very easy to color and roll out easily.
657,"This is real licorice, not the licorice flavored candy you get in US supermarkets.  The flavor is very strong compared to what you find in the supermarket and it is more dense and chewy.<br /><br />If you love licorice you will love this.<br /><br />This Finnish licorice is NOT salty."
658,This is the only way that I've found to have decent (IMO) tea in the US. A pint mug ensures the correct dosage :) (although my Doctor doesn't agree).
659,Spilled my bottle on the floor and my dog licked it up. It must work because i had to keep him form humping my leg for 3 hours.
660,"I'd give this a five star rating except for the fact that it's just a little too spicy. A stick-in-the-back-of-your-throat FIRE kind of spicy. It was easy to prepare and is a large serving, the noodles cook to perfection when you follow the instructions. There are even chunks of real chicken in there! Good value for the money, a nice product to have on hand for a quick meal. I wouldn't serve it to children though, it's probably too hot for them."
661,I have been enjoying product a lot so far. helps me to focus and makes more calm and relax. I did not observe any side effects so far.
662,"This is decent coffee. Nothing special. It is not very strong or distinctive. Does not have much ""jump."" Nothing wrong with it either, except for the fact that for a coffee product that prides itself on being environmentally sensitive, it is being sold in single pod packages that are anything but. Time to leave that sort of contradiction behind."
663,"We purchased the 2lb bag of so-called Kookaburra licorice from SweetGourmet (fulfilled by Amazon) last week.<br /><br />The product was not labeled for retail.  It was in a clear plastic bag, and had only a SweetGourmet.com sticker and a bar code label with ""Kookaburra Black Licorice 2 lb, New, best before 12.30.2012 X00079UEF1"" on it.<br /><br />Pieces of the product have the typical Kookaburra spiral lines on the outside, but the taste is flat or stale to me.  My wife spat it out.<br /><br />Is this a bad knock-off of the real Kookaburra brand?<br /><br />Avoid."
664,First time I tried this.  Ordered it for a friend who has trouble sleeping.  She said it helped.  I will start on it as soon as my current supply of magnesium citrate is depleted.  Gread product and service as always...
665,It is impossible to find MBT broth products in the stores anymore and it is simply the best broth for both cooking and light snacking.  Order came on time and as said.
666,"Our cats love this.  We switched to this for half of their meals from regular dry food to help with urinary problems with one of the cats and to get them away from carb-rich food.  The cats really, really like this and have lost some weight over using Iams dry, weight-loss, hairball formula, which was one of the goals of changing their food.  Also, with it being moist food I can easily add a joint supplement to our older cat's food.  The only downside, like most moist food, is that the cats started having hairballs again.  This is why we give them this for only half of their meals and use dry food for the other half.  I switched their dry food also, but to a brand that isn't sold here, so I won't mention the brand.<br /><br />We love that this doesn't smell bad or give our cats digestive problems.  Cheaper moist cat food smells horrible and upsets our cats' digestive systems (which also smells horrible ;)).  I like that this is made with ""human grade"" ingredients.  I think this must account for the smell.  It smells pretty much like tinned meat a human would eat, like tinned chicken or fish."
667,Kids love them.  They taste close to regular gumballs but no worry about teeth.
668,"I bought this product to go with a Keurig coffee maker for my husband for Christmas.  We have limited counter space, so this was the perfect solution for keeping the K-cups close at hand.  It is well made - there is NO issue that this drawer cannot hold the weight of the machine.  The only thing to consider is the space between your counter and cabinets.  Once the machine is placed on top of the drawer, you may not be able to open the machine the whole way.  In my kitchen, it's just enough to put the K-cups in and out although it will not open the full way.  That's something that you should consider when determining if this product will work for you.  We love it."
669,"I usually buy caramel coffee creamer to go in my cappuccino but with this product, it is creamy without it. Buying by bulk like this offers, saves me money too. I would recommend this product and I will be making another purchase soon."
670,"I purchased this product from Babys R us and was using it for a few months until all of a sudden the steam start button or the blend button wouldn't always consistently worked.  Tried to return to Babys R us with my repceipt.  They wouldn't take it back and said to contact Baby Brezza.  I left an email with customer service in early November and actually got a call back in a day.  She said she would ship out a replacement and I had to ship back the lid.  I still haven't received the replacement as of today (1-10-12).  I left another email last week and haven't heard from anyone.  I will try calling the 888 number tomorrow.  But it doesn't look promising.  If only they'd give me a refund, I can buy the Baeba."
671,"Tastes good.  Nicely spicy, especially for breakfast.<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />I'm somewhat sensitive to MSG.  And I do believe that this has more than I need.  Fine for one day, but by the 3d day in a row, I'm waking up with a headache that sure feels like a MSG headache.<br /><br />At a guess, more than the standard supermarket ramen has.<br /><br />In neither case do I eat ""one serving.""  More likely ""one package"" or allegedly two servings.<br /><br />But if I can space these out, they're fine."
672,Received super fast and amazing packaging! The product is totally awesome! Upon opening the jar I could smell and see the living enzymes! It's so rich and good tasting as well! Highly reccomend this product to anyone looking for raw organic sauerkraut!
673,"We can never count on being able to get Twinings Darjeeling tea, which is my husband's favorite, where we live. I'm thrilled to have such a convenient and reasonably priced source. The delivery was quick and now we won't ever be out.<br /><br />Thank you!"
674,"Every product from Fabrique Delices has exceeded my expectations. This all natural and preservative free product is made in America and syrpasses any expensive French import. This is my 3rd order and I'll order more soon. The seller, Le Village, is not the fastest shipper so be patient. Their packaging consists of a thermal bag and a couple of cold packs. All of my orders arrived with the cold packs melted. I wouldn't order from them if it's too warm outside. They really need to use coolers and dry ice or expedited shipping."
675,"I cannot belive this product is still being sold at Amazon, Costco etc.  The FDA has put out numerous warnings about chicken jerky treats from China.  Go to their website to see.  I would not feed this product to any animal. PERIOD.  Yes dogs like them, but is it worth the risk?  There are jerky treats made in the U.S.A. or better yet, you can make them yourself.  Either in the oven or in a dehydrator.  I use the oven method, cut chicken breast into strips, hang from metal scewers and bake at 200 for 4 hours and you have dried chicken jerky.  Easy, less expensive and good for your pet."
676,"I bought this to better the ""chew"" of my homemade breads.  It works very well and a little goes a long way."
677,"I've tried a number of different granola cereals over the years (including the Kind Healthy Grains Vanilla Blueberry Clusters with Flax Seeds ), and Kind Healthy Grains ranks among the best for taste. I'd call this moderately sweet, which is just fine with me, but it might make this less of a hit with people with more of a sweet tooth, especially kids. Of course, you can always add sugar, fruit or some other sweetener if you think it needs it.<br /><br />As the nutrition facts on the package reveal, this is a fairly healthy breakfast option. There's little fat in a 1/3-cup serving (3.5g/5% total fat, none of which is saturated or trans fat) with no cholesterol. There are 22g/7% carbs of which only 5g/20% are from sugar. There are also 5g/20% fiber, 20mg/1% sodium, and a serving has 130 calories."
678,Muellers Pasta Tastes Fantastic and after boiling it for Twelve Minutes it is Still Al Dente!!! One Box Feeds Four Hungry Eaters and the Twelve Pack Comes at a Great Price!!!
679,"I was crazy about these as a kid! They are tubes simply filled with a flavored powdered candy that has tons of sugar in it. I first tried their wax paper tubes that were about 8 inches long when I was about 7 or 8 years old. Goes to figure that my 8 year old is nuts about these. We used to take our change to the local conveniance store. They came in grape, cherry, and orange, lime and other fruit flavors. Those were very good. But these are the big 21 inch thick plasitc tubes that hold the equivelant of 20 of the paper ones. This offer gets you a case of 50 of the big plastic tubes, in grape, maui punch, cherry, and orange flavors. Lots of fun from the Wonka factory."
680,"Bonne Maman is a great line of preserves, and finding out they made Fig Preserves absolutely made my day. I had found their more traditional flavors at my local grocery, but happened upon their fig preserves at a boutique cafe in my area. However, they were charging $6.99 per jar. I love fig preserves, but $7 is a bit steep. I grew up with a French father, and spent lots of time visiting family in Southern France. I remember having my Aunt's homemade fig preserves on fresh baguettes and croissants for breakfast in the morning throughout my life. I developed a taste for preserves made from mirabelle plums, figs, and still love strawberry as well. And, while Smuckers Strawberry Preserves are fine for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, it's just not the taste or quality I love for breakfast. Bonne Maman also makes a great strawberry, and Four Fruits preserves as well, but fig is by far the best in my opinion. All their fruit preserves have more pieces of real fruit in them than your standard American brands. I love having an actual strawberry or fig turn up on my english muffin rather than just more flavored corn syrup. When I found the fig preserves, in particular, here on Amazon at a more reasonable price (around $4.25 a jar) I was sold immediately. I will definitely use 6 jars of this within several months time, and certainly before they go bad. The irony of this find was that the day after I finally had ordered and received my first 6 jars I stopped by a grocery I don't frequent. There in the jam and jelly aisle were Bonne Maman Fig Preserves on sale for $1.99/jar. I had no idea. Needless to say, I will be checking there first, but will absolutely be buying these again if a $7 jar is my only other option. These are great preserves, and the only better ones I've found come from my Aunt's kitchen. They're a little harder to come by these days."
681,"Panda Bars is a candy my husband remembers loving from childhood and it has now become a favorite of mine and my 2 year old son also. These arrived quickly and now I wish I had ordered 2 boxes because at the rate we are eating these, they will be gone within a week! The Panda Bar's main ingredients are Molassess and Wheat flour - you won't find any high fructose corn syrup in there! I consider other brands like Twizzlers to taste waxy and hard whereas these Panda bars have a nice chewy texture. I love having a box around so I can make sure the diaper bag is stocked with these ready to eat snacks. I like that my 2 year-old son considers these a special treat and I have no guilt about letting him enjoy one. These are sold locally but they are cheaper to order by the box on Amazon."
682,"I remember buying Ragu a few years ago and never buying it again, but I could not remember why. Just look at the container, its tomato sauce, what could go wrong. Everything about it is wrong for me now that I tried it once more and I am writing a review to remind me later. This contains sugar and sugar is same as poison for me, the taste just makes me mad. The container label says there is only 10g of sugar per 1/2 cup/128g serving, but when I eat it it feels like 50g. There is no tangy tomato flavor, it feels like I am eating juice or jam or something too sweet, not pasta sauce like. I compared it with a can of ""Del Monte Chunky garlic and herb"" sauce and Del Monte is so much better. It contains 9g High Fructose Syrup in place of Sugar but I felt it was much more satisfying, tastier, less sweet and more tangy than Ragu and its cheaper too. Did i miss to say Del Monte is Chunky while Ragu is not!, even when labelled Chunky. If you want to buy Del Monte sauce online with fast shipping try Amazon's grocery site ""soap"" dot com. Ragu is America's worst tasting sauce not like advertised at all, more like America's favorite Tomato flavored jam/syrup.<br /><br />Also double checked ingredient list on the bottle and it says sugar while amazon says corn syrup. Amazon should have said sugar and helped me save $18, so 1 star for amazon too."
683,I had previously used this product with great results. I could not find them anywhere in my area. thank you amazon for supplying this great product. I bought a whole case just in the event they were discontinued permanently.Delivered in great shape and taste as good or better than i remembered. thanks again.<br />  f.s.
684,"Highly recommended product! Best marmalade made. Has the a strong orange taste, but not too sweet!  Great seller..... Fast shipper"
685,"This is my favorite first thing in the morning coffee.  During the week I get up between 3:30 am and 4:00 am so I need something to get me going and this coffee does the trick.  I have tried other BOLD coffees, but this is by far my favorite."
686,Trackless litter learls is the way to go. Litter stays near his litter box. Product absorbs urine with limited odor. Cat loves it.
687,"This is hands-down the best discovery I've made since my Celiac diagnosis. It's worth every penny! My daughter and I are now able to make all of our favorite foods from the ""old days""!"
688,"My 2 year old Shih Tzu boy loves this food.  I mix it along with Health Extensions so he has the benefit of both types and flavors of foods.  He was typically a poor eater, but now just ""woofs"" it down!"
689,"This adjustable puzzle toy is a good way to provide a challenging way for your dog to have treats.  It is fun for them if you just put one or two treats inside or many.  The rubber ""feet"" on the bottom do grip the floor somewhat which makes it more stable when the device is tightened up for extra challenge for your dog.  This is one of what could be many puzzle toys to entertain your dog.  My dog gets excited when I bring out a puzzle toy because he knows that with a little work, he gets a treat."
690,Thought I couldn't have a truly delicious decaf espresso at home until I tasted this one. Better than I ever imagined a decaf could taste.  Full robust flavor and aroma.<br />Took advantage of the Amazon Subscribe and save program and couldn't be happier.
691,"I'm not fond of diet drinks, but I cannot bring myself to drink regular.  This is a perfect in-between drink, with loads of flavor and only 4 grams of sugar.  The flavors are light and pleasing to my palate, no nasty fake sugar aftertaste.  This is saying alot because I have several boxes of truvia at home and can't bring myself to use them in my coffee.  I highly recommend this, and am ordering it for myself and my husband to take to work, and drink on hot days.It has a light, tropical flavor, with a gentle citrus aftertaste.  I'm sold, only 30 calories per packet."
692,"My 14 year old Aussie(ZOE)goes nuts over two different treats and this is one of them. She is almost deaf, but I swear she can hear a ziplock back opening from 30 feet away and through walls.Until her ""ARF-ritis"" got so bad, she would chase these like a thrown ball and snatch them out of the air. To my nose, they don't smell too appetizing, but, chase them or not, she loves them."
693,"This is another great coffee from Folgers! It is bolder than the Columbian but the Columbian has better flavor. We enjoy this as much as our everyday coffee <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>. But the Donut shop is still cheaper because of the amazon 50 count frustration free offering's. We will scoop this up any time it drops below 50 cents a cup!"
694,"I don't even remember where or when I bought this tea or if someone gave it to me, but I finally tried it and was totally blown away.  Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
695,"First off, this stuff is expensive.  When I actually sat down to calculate the cost per serving, it came out to be around 75c per cup of tea sweetened.  That's true because 1) it's not cheap per pound and 2) you'll use quite a bit more than you expect per cup of tea, coffee, etc.<br /><br />Next (and last), it irritated my throat.  For me, at least, that ""cooling"" sensation that most everyone else has mentioned also resulted my throat being sore while I drank my tea and for a short while thereafter.<br /><br />It was worth a try but not worth repeating."
696,I washed with the shampoo for moisturizing dry hair by clear. I was very happy with the way it lathered and rinsed. I then followed with this conditioner. I left in on for about 5 min as I took a slow massage shower. It rinsed out well and left my hair feeling silky.<br /><br />To give the ultimate test I let it air dry about till 80% dry and it was going a bit frizzy so I finished with the cool dryer and then a very low setting ceramic ceramic hot iron. My hair looks the best it has for months since it came it frizzy after losing about 1/4 after an illness. It is not total frizz free but this is only one use. It claims 7 days I think it can happen.<br /><br />I don't have to wash everyday so 7 washings will be more than 7 days.<br /><br />I will buy this again and the price cannot be beat. Better than anything a salon has ever used on me.
697,"Out of Korea, China and Japan.  I think Korea makes the best instant ramens.  This one is a long favorite of Koran folks. Noodle is thicker and chewier then  typical ramen.  By the way, Neoguri means raccoon in Korean."
698,"I picked up these when the local pet store stopped carrying the thin bone shaped Little Bitz chicken and rawhide chews. The Beefeaters Little Bitz Small Round Chips are circular wafers of rawhide backing with a hard dried meaty topping. I was reluctant about getting these because they are about 1/4 of an inch thick though they don't seem to be more than an inch in diameter, and well I wasn't sure if it would be too big for my teacup's bite. My picky pooch seems to do ok with them though sometimes the cracking sounds she makes scares her but she cant get enough of these. I prefer the similar product by Beefeaters that are thinner less chunky. These are great for smaller breeds. But be warned they give my dog terrible gas. Only recommend these if you really love your fur babies and won't mind the smell."
699,"I was skeptical that I would like this sweetner. I like to use brown sugar in my oatmeal and I also enjoy baking with it. I ordered this on a chance that I would like it. I've been hearing all the horrors of sugar in our bodies and decided to really search for a substitute for my whole family. Well, I've found it...this sweetner was very good in my oatmeal along side the cinnamon. I was a little more hesitant to use it in my favorite cookie recipe. Well, this evening I used it in my recipe and it was fantastic! I didn't miss the sugar at all and it had no after taste at all. My husband even couldn't tell it was sugar free.<br /><br />So if you're like me and trying to get away from sugar, try this. It might surprise you too."
700,"Each of my three cats loves this flavor of the Temptations Treats. Anytime I go into the kitchen, one or more of my cats follows me in, sits on a perch (each has his own spot so the other will not nibble from the plate of another) and waits for his/her Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treat. This makes it a lot easier to deal with a hairball problem."
701,These syrups are so good!  Not too sweet with great flavor!  I wish they were available for purchase locally though.
702,"These are good if you want something really, really sweet.  I could feel the sugar on my teeth after eating these... They're not terrible, they're fast and easy when you're in a hurry or want a sweet treat that isn't ice cream or (real) candy."
703,"These are light, slightly sweet cracker to eat with peanut butter, soups or plain as a snack."
704,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them."
705,"Well, actually, I had thought that I had found the OLD LONDON Whole Grain Melba Rounds and quickly ordered them.  Opps, it was the toast and not nearly as delightful.  Now I have two cases to eat."
706,"I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves!"
707,"Product arrived promptly and securely packaged. The turkey gizzards were very tender but somewhat mild in flavor (dipped them in mustard to add a little ""zest"" to them when I ate them). Pork Hocks were also tender with a mild flavor. The Polish Sausage I liked the best - a sweeter, vinegary taste (it was hard for me not to eat the whole jar of Polish Sausage in one sitting). The eggs were fine (used them - sliced - on salads).<br /><br />All-in-all, I was very pleased with the sampler as well as the service from WisconsinMade."
708,"Of all the K-Cup flavors we've brewed, this is the best.  It is so good that we have actually subscribed (15% discount!) to receive these boxes every couple months.  The flavor is great and it is extremely convenient in the morning to just pop the K-Cup in our brewer and 15 seconds later we have a hot cup of coffee."
709,"We have used this for a few years. we do rescue dogs and get bite a few times, this stuff is the BEST, works better then anything else we have tried, faster healing, less or no scaring then anything else there is... Works on other wounds just as well. We now use nothing else but this. Great for a bug out bag, or a get home bag/kit in your car. Heat don't bother this like other med's of this style."
710,"The panettone was the first Christmas gift to arrive. Way before Cds, videos, books, dog treats and other items that you think would have been out the next day. It is festively wrapped and smells great. We will cut it on Christmas day. Be careful not to drop it on your foot, it weighs a ton and I am sure will feed a family."
711,"Over the course of fifteen consecutive years, I have eaten many brands of shortbreads made in Scotland.  Of all of these, I enjoy Borders brand the best.  The owners of a small English tea shoppe, where I orginally purchased Borders brand, retired from their business.  That left me not knowing where to find a new seller.  However, I was fortunate to find the product available through Amazon."
712,"Great for picking up doggie poo. Sometimes she has larger piles so I wouldn't mind it they were slightly larger themselves, but overall, great bags. Love that they biodegrade, we use other products of theirs as well, but this was my first introduction. Great idea. Poop breaks down, why keep it locked up in plastic for years?"
713,"Have been on a diet for several months trying to lose a little weight and I was wanting some type of low calorie food that had the necessary nutrients.  Tried another protein shake prior to Special K's.  After purchasing several cartons of it, I tried Special K.  I have since been drinking two to four shakes everyday for a number of weeks and supplementing them with just a little solid food.  I drink the vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry and I like each of them.  To me they taste good and they leave no aftertaste.  I know each person's taste is a little different, but I would recommend them to another."
714,"I have purchased many, many dog foods for my six year old pekingese. His appetite and health are excellent but he prefers people food, especially roast chicken and spinach. He rejects all dog food. Last fall I tried Stella & Chewy's because the description sounded good. He loves the beef and salmon (and the chicken, beef and lamb)so I have continued to order all four. His hair is now glossy and the dinners seem to provide him with good nutrition (I checked each food that I tried for nutrition). Best of all he eats it and asks for it. I'm delighted."
715,"I don't know why someone would say that this is salty, but I have never thought that.  It is great!  My family has been eating this mac n cheese once a week (at least) for over a year.  It is a big crowd pleaser. And amazon.com has a great price... it is $4 a box at the supermarket."
716,"I have not tried multiple brands of this item, but I do know that this item definitley fits the bill.  The chipotles were very spicy (just like I like them) and smelled FANTASTIC.  Plus, the cost to product ratio was very reasonable.  Plus, with free shipping, this item was a lot easier to order through amazon then to have to keep going from store to store to find this item."
717,"Well, Grandpa made out like a king this Christmas.  Grandma bought him some Omaha Steaks (12 oz. ribeyes) and I must tell you that they are delicious!  Gramps shared his steaks with Grams and we had a delightful dinner.  There are six more for him to enjoy and there's not a piece of fat anywhere on them.  They cook even better on the George Foreman grill that went with them as a second gift (also purchased through Amazon.com -- thank you).  It's so easy to clean and he was like a little kid waiting for Santa to finally bring the gifts this year.  Of course, I made out like a bandit this year also, so now we're both flat broke.<br /><br />Who cares?  We have our health, our children and grandchildren, and we have each other for the past 44 years.  Who could ask for anything more?  Thanks to Amazon.com for making our Christmases so special!!"
718,"The Yuban Dark Roast is, I think, an outstanding tasting ground coffee, but is WAY OVERPRICED on the Amazon site.. After I had purchased this in 2010 from Amazon I found it locally at a lower price for the same exact item... It pays to  shop around on some items.."
719,"I've tried many brands and this one stands head and shoulders above them all for flavor (Label ID:  Ajishima Foods, distributed by JFC International).  Don't be confused by all the varieties you see in Asian markets, and if you're new to fishy tastes steer away from the bottles which list fish flakes in the ingredients!  We always serve this with sticky Asian Rice and it's been a hit with all our guests who Asian food palettes may not be as developed as ours...just realized this one is called Nori FUMI Furikake.  The one I have is Nori Komi Furikake - ingredients listed: sesame seed, salt, sugar and seaweed.  Suspect they are very similar."
720,"Great ginger ale! This is what ginger ale is supposed to taste like: a slight bite, a little sweet, a perfect sizzle."
721,"My husband and I first received this coffee as a gift and we've been buying it ever since! The blend is extremely smooth, without any bitterness, ""bite"" or that jittery caffeine feeling. We buy whole bean and the beans are always perfectly roasted and very fresh.<br /><br />And, the value for the two-pound bag is amazing! This coffee compares very comparably, even with some of the so-called Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee - the stuff that supposedly is pure Blue Mountain coffee. I repackage the coffee into one pound bags and grind the beans fresh daily for coffee house quality coffee for only pennies. We buy again and again..."
722,"I sent this as a Christmas gift.  When it arrived, the box it was shipped in was not damaged, but the package the snacks were in only had 11 instead of the 12 it said it should have.  It looked as though someone had very carefully removed one of them."
723,"Curry has officially become my FAVORITE food over the past year. I can't believe I waited 35 years to try it.<br /><br />We went through all of the grocery store curry pastes and never could find one that had great flavor and spice.<br /><br />Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park! We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry. These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk (we've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories)<br /><br />A definite MUST HAVE for curry lovers<br /><br />Add some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016UX0K"">Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce, 25-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a> to your pantry too!"
724,Wonderful chocolate cookies and much healthier than most others.  You have to try these!
725,"The cream cheese was a little hard to taste in this cookie that is why I gave it a four star rather than a five star. Overall, this is a good cookie, not too large and not too small with just the right amount of chocolate. I would buy again."
726,There is such a great cinnamon flavor to this gum!  The cinnamon oils lend a strong and natural tasting flavor.  It is made with no sugar substitutes which is why I bought it and the Xylitol ingredient is good for your teeth.  I was very satisfied with the length of the flavor as well as the texture of the gum even after a long chew.
727,"Regular rolled oatmeal is just downright boring compared to these steel cut oats.  These have a great texture and much better flavor than rolled oats.  It's become a bit of a tradition for Saturday breakfast to have these oats really done up right with a recipe from America's Test Kitchen that I found on the Valley Fig Grower's website ""Perfect Oatmeal with Honey Fig Topping with Vanilla and Cinnamon.""  These oats really don't need much help to be a filling, fueling, delicious breakfast, but that recipe just sends them way over the top.  I haven't tried any other brands of steel cut oats, and to be honest, I haven't seen any other brands in our local stores."
728,"These arrived quickly as I ordered them on a lightning deal. They look fabulous, they smell even better, they were fresh, they were attractive looking...................the problem? My 2 Yorkies won't touch them........sniff them and then walk away........even cut up in little pieces. I'll have to give them away unless I get desperate for cookies and decide to eat them myself!"
729,"This drink is great specially if you like cherry flavor,you can add as much water as you like and its good for you too."
730,"These are the best little suckers I've ever had, sweet with a little tartness to them.  Even my husband likes them, used to never see him with a sucker in his mouth.  I will definitely order more when these give out."
731,"This product sounds good, but can you trust anything made in CHINA that you would eat? I bought 2 bags and ate some of the product. I was good and had a nice flavor. Then I looked at and read the bag. I small print at the very bottom of the back of the bag were the words ""A PRODUCT OF CHINA"". I threw the rest out and will not buy any more. If they can poison our pets, they can poison us as well."
732,smooth.  I normally drink dark roasts but purchased this on a lightning deal (or maybe a friday sale).  I like it.
733,I love the Dark Magic coffee and this seemed to be the best deal I can find.  I go through about 6 cups a day and setting up for regular delivery is awesome!!!
734,"I'll admit it: I'm a freak. I don't like onions or garlic. Shoot me.<br /><br />Other than the evil alliums in this dressing, though, it's like serious salad dressing crack. There's something sweet and salty and vinegary about this dressing that combine in perfect harmony to make a really awesome dressing.<br /><br />Strangely, I like it OK in salads, but I like it even better on a sandwich. Ever get oil and vinegar on your sandwich? It's like that, only better. There's gotta be MSG in this stuff, because - wow, it's addictive.<br /><br />The onions and garlic definitely cheapen the flavor to me, so it only gets four stars, but if you like dried or granulated onions and garlic, you'll dig this dressing. Also good to dip soybeans in."
735,"Frontier makes the best spices, bar none.  Tastes as though you've just chopped fresh garlic.  Wonderful.  I've also used the dill - also wonderful.  I recommend Frontier."
736,"After finishing my can of Rapunzel Organic Cocoa Powder, I couldn't find it again online or in stores.  So, I purchased Equal Exchange.  It has nonfat milk already in the mix which the powder did not.  This is easier when traveling. It also contains organic sugar cane juice so you don't need to add sugar, either. I enjoy the taste of it. It has 70 calories per serving size. You have to order it in a pack of 3 but that wasn't an issue for me."
737,these were all really good except the apple ones.  i only made it through one apple one until i gave the rest away.
738,"Please be aware that while this is a hard to find ingredient, and this might seem an affordable source, the ingredients are different on the actual container than on the website. Mine contained rice flour, gum arabic, asafoetida, tumeric and wheat flour.<br /><br />This is a real deal breaker for anyone with a wheat problem/ celiac!!<br /><br />I gave a low rating for the misinformation, and also that asafoetida is the third ingredient which is disappointing."
739,We have only used the mushroom soup for cooking with other ingredients.  Seems too thin to use and get the same consistency as accustomed to.
740,This KIND bar is pretty intense.  The chocolate and cherry combo create a really strong flavor. The palm kernal oil ingredient in the chocolate is a concern as that oil is not said to be very healthy.
741,"Here is another perfectly heavenly tea by STASH.<br /><br />The flavor here is Strawberry and Pomegrante...and it gets very high marks from me for its excellent fruity ,soothing , wonderful smelling fruit tea.<br /><br />Price point is the lowest I have ever seen so I added this to the automatic delivery program.....<br /><br />I can see me drinking and enjoying this tea morning , noon and night and on the coldest winter day and the hottest summer night as Ice Tea.<br /><br />Its a winner with its taste , packaging and great storage box.<br /><br />Its FINE !!"
742,"I am new to making bread.  I inherited a 10-year old, hardly used bread machine and have worked to find a good whole wheat bread recipe.  I usually don't like bread maker bread, but I put forth the effort because I like to know what goes in my food. Using the gluten really made the bread much more like the sandwich bread that my kids are used to. This gluten is the only kind I've tried so far and had no problems with it --but I did buy this at my local grocery store.  I use one tablespoon or so per cup of whole wheat flour"
743,Simple.... Haven't found a dog that didn't LOVE these.  The quality was the first reason for using these.  Their acceptance sealed the deal.  I regularly buy a half dozen bags to cut down on shipping.  All I can say is my favorite poodle Mimi loves them...SPIKE
744,"These are spicy, and my kids love them too. They are crispy and I am SO glad I found these after being diagnosed with Celiac."
745,There is a reason the seller doesn't display the ingredients: the first ingredient is sugar; the second is partially hydrogenated palm kernel oil.  Kellogg's should be ashamed of trying to position this as a healthy meal replacement.
746,"It is important to get the pasta out of the boiling water as the instructions tell you.  When you do that, it is perfect.  Nice texture and holds together."
747,This is the first time to try the decaf and I am very pleased. Flavor is better then expected and I will buy again and reccomend to others.
748,Coffee is very good and as far as k-cups go it is a very good price.I order them all the time from amazon
749,"I purchased this for my mother who is currently undergoing some powerful chemotherapy. During her first chemo, she hated everything because everything tasted like metal and it was short of pulling teeth to get her to eat something. She called me and asked me to order her this because an oncology nurse that she is friends with suggested it. During her second chemo she ate all her normal foods and actually enjoyed it making the entire process of eating during chemo a small miracle. We were so happy that she was eating because of this that we ordered more immediately!"
750,This is great coffee at a fair price. Amazon has the best deals and super fast shipping.
751,"My dog just isn't a ""tugger"" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it."
752,"Really love O.N.E coconut water. The mango flavor is sweet, good for my sweet tooth, but other people may prefer the unflavored coconut water for refreshment without sweetness."
753,"My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural. He loves this one too and as previsouly mentioned, we've seen such a change in his fur - softer and much shinier."
754,Regular flavor Budda Bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these.
755,"I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said ""Dark Chocolate"" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as ""Dark Hot"" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says ""Dark Chocolate"" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside."
756,I first had these cookies at our Oktoberfest where they were giving out samples.  I loved them and could not find them at World Market so I went to the internet and found them available at Amazon. They are very light and flaky.
757,"I've tried many different sauces.  Tapatio stands at the top of the pack.  It's not as spicy as Tobasco, but spicy enough without the vinegar taste.  You can use it with lemon on Doritos Chips, and Ramen Noodles."
758,"This gum contains xylitol as one of its main ingredients. I am currently in dental hygiene school and thus have recently learned the benefits of xylitol. The reason this is so good is that it is a natural sweetener that tricks bacteria into thinking it's regular sugar. When bacteria ingest it they have no way to digest it, which results in death of the bacteria and therefore lowers your risk for cavities when used daily.<br /><br />Now for anyone who has TMJ issues (if you don't have TMJ, then you don't have to bother reading this one paragraph) it is recommended that you not chew gum at all. I myself am one of these people. Whenever I chew gum my jaw ends up hurting for days. However, I spoke with the dentist at my college about this issue and he actually recommends to continue chewing xyliotol gum but to only chew for 5 minutes maximum, particularity after sugary snacks only. For myself, this seems to work. If I eat something high in sugar and chew Spry gum for only 5 minutes afterward, it'll help get the xyliotol in my mouth to fight off cavity causing bacteria but won't be long enough to cause me pain in my jaw.<br /><br />Overall, if you're one who gets cavities often, try Spry gum!"
759,"Hard to find in grocery stores!  I think Hidden Valley replaced it<br />with a 'Spicy Ranch' packet, but it not even close to the Fiesta Ranch<br />flavor.  Makes best ever dip mixed with sour cream, chopped olives,<br />chopped jalapenos and 1 1/2cups shredded cheese!"
760,"Anyone who's ever made cocoa the old fashioned way - with Hershey's powder, know what really good, 'real' hot chocolate tastes like. Of every brand of 'instant' hot chocolate I've had (and I've had them all!), Chip Davis's CINNAMON HOT CHOCOLATE is the very best. Thanks."
761,"I made a mistake purchasing this anchor bar original wing sauce online this was slightly over $10 a bottle, I was shopping at a super Kmart when I came across the same anchor bar original wing sauce for only $4.49. This was my own fault I should've neve purchased a small bottle of wing sauce no matter what brand for that price $10."
762,"Love Cliff bars, but have only liked the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Peanut Crunch flavors (maybe an occasional Blueberry).  The others are too sweet for my taste.  These are my new favorite.  Great taste combination.  Go Cliff Bars!"
763,As advertised this drink gives you a long boost when you need energy and you are out of it. with a very fruity flavor the drink delivers its promises.
764,We have ordered antlers from many onlint sources and have found most have inferior quality.  This brand has always been a great value and great quality.  I  would reccommend this brand to anyone looking for antlers.......Why would you buy from some online store when you can have the best from Amazon!
765,I have loved Nature Valley Crunchy granola bars for many years. They taste great and are perfect for when hunger stricks and the next meal is still a couple hours away.<br />They satisfy hunger and get you some of the fiber you need each day. I love the texture and the large whole oats.<br />A great granola bar!
766,"These chips are outstanding!!  Use in place of tortilla chips with salsa, and you will never go back. Forget the fact that they are healthy, these chips are delicious!"
767,"Got these for my sister as a personal gift to my older sister. We used to (and still occasionally) do eat these by the ton, so I was glad to find a bulk amount at a pretty decent price."
768,"Starbucks decaf Via is a great thing for travelers, and this product is actually a very good buy.  The Vias usually sell for about $1 per serving."
769,"I just love it, the popcorn pops fast and when it is done you have real old fashioned movie theater popcorn just like the old days"
770,"I've had a problem with moles for just a few months, but they have done quite a bit of damage to my yard in that short time.  After reading the positive reviews, I decided to try the Out of Sight trap.  It took me a few weeks but I finally caught one mole (I'm sure there's more out there).<br /><br />I tried following the directions on the box as well as the directions in the reviews here.  I didn't have much success with just cutting slits for the blades and leaving the trap at ground level.  I eventually dug up a small area and I noticed that the hole runs were actually a little deeper than the blades would go if left on top of the grass. The cool weather may have something to do with the moles digging deeper; or I simply chose a bad spot. However, it was the most active area so seemed to be a logical choice to set the trap.<br /><br />So, I basically followed the included instructions and finally caught my first mole.  As others have said, you may need to finish off the little diggers yourself so just be prepared for that...I guess a shovel is the best tool for the job.  The traps do require a bit of strength to set and you need to be careful with them as the spring is very strong. At first glance it looks like some kind of medieval torture device.<br /><br />Another thing to remember is that often times moles are simply a symptom of other problems - mostly likely lawn grubs. I'm certainly not an expert, but it sounds like moles feed largely on these grubs. So getting rid of the grubs may prevent future moles...that's next on my to do list."
771,This is a Knock-off of k-cups.  Never thought amazon would sell a knock-off product..  Instant coffee in a k-cup holder.
772,"In the 7+ years I've been using Amazon, this is the first review I've ever written.  Why now?  I just have to let others know that this protein shake is incredible in every way; the taste, organic certification!!, and nutritional profile is hands down the best ready-to-drink I've ever come across.  My wife and I were shocked at that there is organic whey protein (VERY hard to find!) and that wonderful fruit and veggie blend.  I'm a personal trainer so I recommend this to all my clients now as an ideal replenisher.  I feel a considerable difference in my energy and health.  I'll be using Subscribe and Save from now on for this!  I highly, highly recommend this drink if your looking to an alternative to all the junk out there."
773,"I bought these recently as a Friday special for a great price.  These came quickly and I have one bag open and the others hidden so I don't eat them all.  These are huge bags and the candy is nice and fresh.  Wish the peanut butter ones would come in bags like these and sold thru Amazon, not another seller who charges shipping.  Thanks for the good sale on these."
774,beet product of its kind. work great in brewing beer process. Would recomend for adding heat only to foods and not adding flavor.
775,"Oh, yuck.  This stuff was gross.  I didn't really enjoy the kiwi berry, but at least it was tolerable.  The watermelon, however, is completely undrinkable.  I usually like watermelon flavored things, but this is disgusting, it doesn't taste like watermelon at all.  It's actually a blend of several different juices, plus the ascorbic acid, and the blend does not meld at all.  It's just bitter, overly sweet, and has a nasty aftertaste.  Gross, gross, gross."
776,"I have 2 boston terriers and they eat everything (from dry food to meat, veggies, fruit- when they hear crunching apple or peeling cucumber they run for vitamins in seconds) and they like dogs snack as well. But I don't like some thick rawhide sticks because they became slimy and sometimes I have to dig in my dogs' throats to get leftovers (great choking hazard).<br /><br />I was a bit worried after reading negative reviews, I didn't want my dogs to get sick and me being sick from the vet bills. But I gave my dogs one stick each and they liked it a lot. It took them about 20 minutes to finish. I was watching them and they really enjoyed that thing. I was surprised that rawhide part was actually coming off in small bites, easy to swallow (second dog was rather chewing on it though). One dog finished earlier and was intimidating the other, so he swallowed about 1/4 of the chewed stick and I ended up with finger in his throat, so I guess they will enjoy them under my supervision.<br /><br />I took one star for the price, it comes to more than 50 cents per stick (I see the price is changing, it was as high as one dollar per stick)-kind of expensive. Also I would be more happy with the long lasting snack like that to be more safe (that can be my dogs chewing and swallowing bigger parts). But so far I am happy to see occupied dogs and they have no digestive problems at all with a bit looser poop than unusual, but nothing runny and weird (gotta pick it up on the walks). But as it says, the snack is digestive support, so it is not a daily snack, more of a helper with constipated dog."
777,This is a high quality dog food for a reasonable price.  My dogs love this food and they even lost some weight since they have been eating it.  I've shopped around and Amazon always has the best price.
778,"I have been gluten-free for a year now, and this is hands-down my favorite cereal - just the right amount of sweetness and crunch. And I love that it's made with brown rice. Awesome stuff!"
779,"It's been two weeks since I began bulk aging this Barolo kit and I am impressed so far.  The wine, even at this early stage is very drinkable, and has a beautiful, deep red color.  My only regret is having stabilized it before doing a malolactic fermentation, but I will do that on the next one.<br /><br />I took reviewer Duane's advice and used BM 4X4 yeast which I was able to buy in 30 gram packages from Fermentation Solutions in Campbell, Ca.  I also made this kit to 5.5 gallons and added 1 1/2 lbs of Zante currants (available on Amazon) for body.<br /><br />Though I have two much more expensive Winexpert kits going, I expect I'll be drinking this Barolo as my table wine while the other more expensive kits age.  You won't go wrong buying this kit, and with a few tweaks you'll have a very nice table wine for under 2 bucks a bottle."
780,I had dark circles and uneven skin before I used this product. It works well. It's kind of on the expensive side for something so little though.
781,"So so good!  Delicious, easy to prepare food!  I would definitely order again.  Had a gourmet taste, and took only minutes to get ready.  Yum!!!"
782,"This fondant is not white, which defeated the whole purpose of my purchasing fondant.  It is the same off-white color as my marshmallow fondant.  It was for a wedding cake and I was running late, so I figured I would just use it anyway.  The fondant was so soft I could not get it on the cake.  Every time I tried to roll it out and get it on the cake it would stick to itself or stretch out or tear.  I ended up racing to the store and buying Wilton fondant -- which I hate.  The taste of Wilton is gross, but at least it was white and I could get it on the cake."
783,"I had been looking for a healthy, natural protein shake at a decent price and this is it! It tastes great and even when purchased retail at Whole Foods, which isn't known for their low prices, it is affordable. You are better office buying in bulk but either way, great product at a good price."
784,"Of course, it's a taste opinion.  I gave it four stars because it's easy and quite edible.  Probably three stars as just food.<br /><br />Wrap a tortilla around some or eat it plain, it makes an interesting and fairly good, filling meal.  I have no idea why somebody would toss it; it just ain't that bad, folks.  Not the greatest din-din in the world; but not at all bad, either.  But then, if you hate chewing a taco, then you may not like it.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer the Stroganoff and love the chicken and biscuits.  I've ordered the Alfredo, so we'll see about that.  However, these are all easy meals for a decent price.  I'm a retired guy living along, so they're great for me.  Probably a nice idea for a college student or two.  For anyone, a nice package to have around for a busy day.  Feeds two hungry folks, three normal folks.  A bit skimpy for four; unless they're dieting."
785,"These bowls arrived last week and almost half of them were broken.  Since we bought these to substitute as bowls to do less dishes, defeated the purpose for sure.  They are tasty enough, but not nearly as good as most waffle bowls or cones you get at an ice cream shop.  Disappointing, won't purchase again."
786,"But there is something strange about the packaging.  My home is constantly over 76F, so it is always a liquid.  When it arrived, the box was partially soaked with coconut oil.  I can't find the leak and the bottle and inner seal seems to be ok.  Since I only use it for hair and skin care, I am keeping it.<br /><br />The smell is really nice and not overwhelming.  Maybe it's the only oil available in bulk that do not put off people with the smell.<br /><br />Update: It's the same thing when my other oils arrived.  They are dense.  Since their bottles are almost unbreakable, they packaging is normally just big air bubbles loosely around them.  They experience violence forces during transit.  The bottles have a pretty normal secure seal like any normal products in the supermarket.  But their seal broke during individual transit.  That explains the slight leaks.  When fall comes, the oil turn into a beautiful solid.<br /><br />Now I understand what is a light oil.  Coconut oil is not.  You can't apply it to your hair without using a normal shampoo to remove the greasy feeling.  The strong greasy feeling that you cannot stand going to bed with it in your dry hair.  You may want a thick oil for the skin though.  You got instant soft skin even for hardened sole.  But whether it does anything to the skin long term is another story.<br /><br />BTW, many other oils are near odourless.  This oil is the exception that have a faint coconut odour to it."
787,"If you like hot sauce, but not too hot where you can't enjoy your food, then this is the sauce for you!  I love this sauce, it's great on everything.  I use it as like a steak sauce on my meat and if yo uput some in on your wings, mmmmm...tasty!<br /><br />Not for the faint of heat, it is hot!"
788,"Talk about resting on your laurels, the only thing this coffee is good for is adding a nice aromatic accent to the kitchen in the mornings.  It has no real coffee or chocolate taste - just a bland nothingness.  You'd be better off squirting some Hershey's syrup into a cup of Folgers than drinking this bilge water.  Save your money..."
789,"This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating. I don't like getting chunks of the powder through my straw as its a bit shocking!"
790,"Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum."
791,"I had been subscribing to this gun powder tea; it was very good tea given the price. But now it is terrible, I am not sure I can even call them gun powder tea anymore - it doesn't look like it, doesn't smell like it either. Time to find an alternative."
792,"This has become a family favorite side dish. You can use it as is, but it's even better when you gussy it up a little. We like broccoli and parmesan. Cook fresh broccoli flowers right in it or on top of it for the last 10 min. add spice sack and parmesan."
793,"I had a small bag of Chicken Poppers that I took on a trip with us.  Dogs can get pretty finacky in a strange environment but the chicken poppers really settled her down.  And they had such a satisfying crunch when she ate them!  I had no idea where to get more, but then I found them on Amazon!  THanks for a great product!"
794,"It's really nice not having to run to the grocery store and having sugar for my coffee delivered to my door, but the price is a little exorbitant, and a pound really isn't as much as it sounds like. I'm a 24-year old bachelor, so I don't think these things through like I should. If you were as idiotic as me, this is to let you know that.<br /><br />- You can buy sugar about 3 times cheaper at any grocery store.<br />- I realize my own stupidity led to this purchase, but that's why I'm trying to clue you in ;)<br />- By the way, the cardboard container is very poorly designed.<br /><br />- If you're determined to experience the convenience of having sugar delivered to your door, the purchase the five pound bag for a few dollars more here:"
795,"My kids have tried all of the Ella's Kitchen ""smoothies"" and love them.  (By the way, they make baby food ones, too.)  This is a real blessing for any busy mom who has her hands full.  Or any on-the-go mom.  We brought these on a 4-day roadtrip and they were a lifesaver!  Everytime our kiddos got hungry, we'd hand them back one of these.  They could open and close them themselves, it was a very healthy snack, and it was not at all messy.  Ella's Kitchen pouches are notably easier than most squeezable fruits we've tried and we've pretty much tried them all--the tops are nice and big and easy for even toddlers to unscrew and screw back on. This one is a mix of currants, blueberries, bananas, and apples.  The other flavors are The Green One, The Yellow One, and the Red One. So yummy!"
796,"Unique blueberry flavor, but this is a VERY lightly roasted coffee.  You may want to pass if you enjoy a stronger cup of coffee."
797,I ORDERED THE DARK HOT COCOA IN HOPES IT WOULD BE REAL CHOCOLATEY AND IT WAS NO BETTER THAN BUYING A POUCH OF HOT CHOCOLATE AND ADDING IT TO HOT WATER. I ACTUALLY THINK THE POUCH ADDED TO HOT WATER IS LOADS BETTER AND A WHOLE LOT CHEAPER!!!! V-E-R-Y ...D-I-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-E-D! FOR THE PRICE...IT'S A RIP-OFF!
798,I counted on this stuff to get me through college once I moved out of the dorms and tried eating healthier (no health issues; I just wanted  to start being careful). I used to shove ramen packs in the back of the cupboard and use this instead; I'd boil chicken breasts in it; I'd cook regular pasta in it; I'd drink it as a warm drink in the Michigan winter. Now I'm down South and can't find this anywhere. If only it came in packs smaller than 12 bottles on Amazon.
799,"I LOVE these Nature Valley bars. I eat a pack pretty much every day to keep my going between classes. So, when I saw that Amazon sold this large of an amount, I decided to buy from them. Plus this variety pack has very appealing flavors! The peanut butter flavor is especially good--you can actually tell that there's real P.B. because some of it gets stuck on the inside of the wrapper. YUM! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone--especially with the cheap prices from Amazon."
800,"These Danielle coconut chips are absolutely outstanding.  I typically don't like coconut (mostly the texture...flavor is okay), but these are one of the best snacks I've ever eaten.  I've recently introduced them to three different family members who ordered them immediately upon trying them.  The texture and flavor are wonderful...tiny little ribbons of crisp coconut.  And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough."
801,We really enjoy De Boles Angel Hair pasta.  It isn't heavy and it is very tasty.  My kids are picky and this is the best product we have found to appease their request for quick and easy pasta.
802,Thanks for being so prompt at sending my vanilla beans.  They came to me fresh.  I will be doing business with you again.  Thanks again
803,"Our 2 little dogs really like these treats and wait anxiously each morning for them. Often bring empty kongs and drop at my feet for more! It's hard to find the small size in local stores, so it's great to be able to order them on line."
804,"I bought this for my boyfriend, because he loves everything spicy. He loves hot sauce on almost everything. I made sandwiches for him, and he absolutely loves them and this peanut butter. I however, would only use this for cooking."
805,"I recently received a roll of this jerky chew, and will say that THIS is what jerky chew should be like! I have previously tried and reviewed the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZI0RG"">Jack Links Chew, Original Flavor, 0.32-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>. That stuff tasted like ground up cardboard and pepper that blows away when you open the can. Buffalo Bill's chew is has plenty of flavor, but also is actual shredded (not ground) jerky. The only fault is that occasionally you might get a little chunk that's too big for your lip, which makes it kind of painful. But I usually just chew those right up anyhow. This chew is neither too dry nor too moist.<br /><br />I like to use jerky chew when riding horses or working in dusty conditions, as it helps keep my mouth moist. And though it's not laced with caffine or nicotine, it does help keep you awake because it keeps your mouth and mind busy.<br /><br />I will say without a doubt that this is the best jerky chew I've tried thus far. Even my kids like it!"
806,"hello,<br /><br />i don't care if it's manufacturer's or Amazon's description, but it's weak. 1, you can't blow up product picture. 2. description is inconsistent. sometimes it states quantity in box, but most of the time, it does not, as with this size ""petite"". by the way, can someone tell the manufacturer it's bad french, there's no ""e"" at the end?!<br /><br />thanks"
807,I've always purchased this tea in bags. Wanted to see if it tasted the same in the kcups. I really do love this tea but it is economicly better to by it by the bags. kcups are great and convenient but just a bit more than I want to spend right now.....
808,"I have been using this product for two years now and love it.  I purchase the capsules version, even though my dog takes two tablets a day, because you get larger pockets with the capsule version.  I cut each pocket in thirds use each piece to cover the small pills I give my dog. There is no waste and the package lasts three times longer.  My dog loves takes her meds with no problem."
809,"Don't really know the purpose of this product.  It is not the almond flour you are looking for.  It says gluten free but it does not seem to be for me.  For those who are looking for no carbohydrate don't miss the ""Blend"" on the label because it is not what are you looking for.  If you are using this product you may as well use full blown all purpose flour from the store."
810,"The nuts were very large and great tasting;  They are raw, so I can roast them myself as needed;  i would recommend these to anyone! I will order again!"
811,"For this Texan living many years in NYC, good canned chili is a necessity when I don't have time to make my own. The national brands have been blanded down too much. Wolf's -- made in Texas bit not available in supermarkets in NYC --  is one of the very few which doesn't need to have additional chili powder to be hot enough.  I'm glad to be able to get it thru Amazon at a reasonable price with free postage."
812,"Just got these delivered by Amazon to hand out for Halloween. They are so old and stale I will not give them out. Then I find out Amazon doesn't allow returns of this old candy. They will be thrown in the trash. WARNING...I'm warning you about buying food from Amazon without knowing the sell by/freshness date. You too could be stuck with old food which can't be returned. Never again, Amazon."
813,"This spreads out in a pan and sticks together pretty good.  If you put enough ""stuff"" and pizza sauce on the top it isn't half bad.  Since I put very little pizza sauce it lacks a lot to me.  I shall continue to use it and prefect my own ""stuff"" to make it good."
814,"These taste just like banana runts (my favorite)!  Great treat for tropical theme birthday parties, pinata filling, or stocking stuffers for people like me who love these banana flavored candies!"
815,I purchased this box for my mother because she loves having tea with her friends. She loved it! the only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because I have not tried the tea... but I heard it is very good. The presentation is wonderful and it is ideal for entertaining.
816,"I'm giving Tinkyada Brown Rice Pasta (in all its shapes and sizes) my highest recommendation--it surpasses every other brand I've tried of gluten-free pastas--and being a pasta lover, I have tried many brands. No weird texture/taste with Tinkyada and it cooks up as creamy or al dente as you want with a simple addition/reduction of cooking time. Sauces cling to it exceptionally well. Had a gloppy problem with Japanese yam-based noodles, and the other brands of rice/corn noodles had strange textures and tastes. Tinkyada, I love you for the wonderful pasta dishes I thought were gone forever. Thank you so much!"
817,I was looking for something that would hold a lot of kpaks and not take up a lot of space.  This is it!  I really like this pod drawer.  The one thing that is sometimes frustrating is when you have to pull a drawer out to get to a kpak in the back if you don't have the paks in there just right it gets hung up.  But overall it works great and takes up little space!
818,"My husband and I really like the idea the 100% whey protein and corn syrup isn't one of the first ingredients as it is in the other formulas. I also really like the scoop they give. It is more narrow and conducive for dumping into the regular width bottles. My only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't shake up as well as I would like, leaving some clumps. However, we shake it up really well and usually put it in the fridge for the next feeding. After warming it up for the feeding and another quick shake, the clumps are usually gone. The good thing is that the formula doesn't stay bubbly after shaking like the Similac did for us."
819,"I'm running out of ideas to put this excellent sauce on. Great on salads , nacho chips , even spread on a bagel. This is the product to buy if you like the chipotle taste. But remember , a little goes a long way. A great value for the $$$$$ , as the bottle really lasted a long time , due to the small amount used in each serving."
820,"As a therapist I have very little time at work to eat, this is a tasty wonderful option, with a high amount of protein. This by itself will keep me full for at least three hours! LT"
821,"I've had several of the brothers all natural products and purchased several cases after reading that they are a company in western ny. I liked supporting what I assumed was a small business operating in a big apple growing area of the country. It turns out that they just repackage a product that comes to them from china. I emailed the company and they tried to assure me that they are positive their chinese product is of the highest quality and the reason for the apples coming from china when there are apple orchards in their backyard (I've driven by the plant and apples grow all over around there) is because there are no freeze drying facilities in the us. This doesn't make any sense because I checked a package of mountain house freeze dried apples and they are made in the us from us produce.<br /><br />If buying chinese produce doesn't bother you then these are for you, they do taste good but if you're concerned with the huge amounts of less safe pesticides used in china and with the questionable quality of chinese food products then steer clear."
822,"My husband loves these chips. The are high protein, full of fiber, and organic. They are the perfect size to add to lunches, so much better for you than regualar chips. Only problem is they are not always available but we try to get them whenever they are."
823,It's all been said and it's all true. There is a reason that all the reviews are 5 star. Just superb.
824,"I found this product on a doctors website.  It was touted as a very good product.  It is.  I thought the price was a bit high,so, I looked here on Amazon and found it $11 less than on the MD's site!  Great product at a great price.  It tastes better over ice!"
825,I bought this and thought it was a good deal... WRONG!!!  The bags that I got were full of gristle and I ended up throwing it away because it was NOT enjoyable eating.
826,"This is another food I have recently added to my kitties rotation of quality foods.  I bought a small can of it to see if they liked it and they went crazy for it!  They are on Wellness, Natural Value (sold here), Natural Balance, By Nature Organics and now this one.  All offer superb nutrition at very reasonable prices.  I love giving my babies the best!  They deserve it!"
827,"Stumbled on this in Walgreens while rushing to work.<br />Decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />I was suprised-tasty and good quality. Included fork, sturdy plastic bowl.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quickly prepared lunch while at work-you cannot go wrong with this.<br /><br />PS.<br />This can not be compared to ramen noodles-totally different class of product here."
828,"We're really enjoying our new coffee maker, trying different types of coffee. This one wasn't our favorite. We figured from Louisiana it would be stronger, but it wasn't. We're going to keep trying others, looking for a favorite."
829,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N1662M"">Ortiz El Velero Bonito Del Norte Tuna Packed in Olive Oil 250 Grm Tin</a><br /><br />Well worth the price! It is by far the best tuna I have ever eaten. I had planned on adding a little mayonnaise, but after the first bite, I realized there was no need for any enhancement. It would be like putting steak sauce on a good steak. It was so good, I just ate it just as it was. If you want to try really good tuna, this it it! Beware, you will probably want more of this after you try it. You're other brand will not compare to this."
830,I am pleased that we can get this by the pack at a good price.  Retail stores in my area only have mixed packs - this doesn't help us as this Savory Salmon Feast is the only one my Mom's cat will eat!  He approves of this purchase as well but he wishes that he could have more than a can-a-day.
831,"Love the package and the individually wrapped ""cakes"". Very visually appealing-would make a great gift.<br /><br />Please don't get turned off by hearing that you must chop or blend the cakes of chocolate before mixing in the milk then mix it all in a blender. Sure, you can do that and I'm sure the froth is wonderful however, give my method a try. It's super simple, I promise.<br /><br />First get a LARGE mug and fill with milk OR water. Nuke in the microwave for a minute or two. Place the entire chocolate ""cake"" slowly into the cup so it drops to the bottom. Let sit for a minute then with your spoon gently stir it around. The chocolate melts very quickly and easily. Now enjoy! The package does not say to use the whole cake but with a large cappucino mug, it was the perfect amount.<br /><br />As for the reviewer who thought kids may not like it, I have to share that my 5 and 8 yr olds loved it!<br /><br />One last thing, I bought mine (same size) at the regular grocery store for less than $4."
832,I love this Lentil soup. I was thrilled to see it available on Amazon.com. It can be difficult to find in the grocery store.<br />The price is terrific on Amazon!
833,"Our cat doesn't like the feline Pill Pockets so much, but he loves these canine beef ones. (Our vet said it was fine to give him doggie PPs.) And, the pieces are big, so I can use only half a Pill Pocket each day for his pills--saves me money. (I take the half Pill Pocket and split it in half, as he takes two pills a day.) Anyone who has ever had to ""pill"" a cat knows what a relief it is to just give a treat and the pilling is done. Great product."
834,"I found that this tea really helped increase my milk supply. It tasted a little funny at first, but I quickly got used to it. The price on Amazon is unbeatable, especially if you use subscribe and save."
835,"Our Great Pyrenees has to take antibiotics for three weeks and figured out the cheese trick after a few tries.  So I bought these, and he chewed the greenie and spit the pill out.  His mother will down almost any food without swallowing, but my dog insists on chewing, therefore, he finds the pill.  Waste of money.<br /><br />If your dog is a ""chewer"", I'd think twice."
836,"As far as the ingredients are concerned, the chips do seem healthier than regular chips. BBQ flavor is my favorite.  Be careful they are addicting and you could eat a whole bag if you were really hungry.  I haven't yet but i've eaten half a bag."
837,"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:17 Mins<br /><br /></span>My eastern european recipe for the best cup of Tisano chocolate tea ...<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0"">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>"
838,I bought this and thought it was a good deal... WRONG!!!  The bags that I got were full of gristle and I ended up throwing it away because it was NOT enjoyable eating.
839,I love this product! Thanks for the speedy service and extra packaging that keeps it dry even in the rainy Pacific NW.
840,"Bear Naked Granola Fruit and Nut is our very favorite granola, but my order on 1/5/07 arrived, and the batch I ordered did not seem as fresh as the others I have ordered.  Specifically, the raisins in each bag were so hard we had to spit them out. So hard you could not chew them.<br /><br />The other six bags I ordered on 1/5/07 were a gift.  I sure hope the batch the recipient received was not that stale.<br /><br />Our previous orders of this same product proved to be just great!"
841,i kind of grew up on this and it still tastes great! it works well with rice or on its own.  it can even be used in lasagnes or other recipes if you so  desire
842,"I have heard a lot of reviews about coconut palm sugar (especially on Dr. Oz), so I decided to buy some.  Quite honestly, it has been kinda difficult finding things that I can use this stuff on or with.  I love coconut but it has a very distinct taste, which is not good in combination with some other flavors.  For the most part, this product is a novelty and has remained unused in my pantry. It isn't too expensive though and should be tried."
843,"I've been buying these pods for years, and have a ""Subscribe & Save"" program for them through Amazon. I like strong coffee, and these are the strongest I've found. However, today I opened up the first bag of my latest shipment and noticed the pods were very thin; had much less coffee in them. Sure enough, they made a VERY weak cup of coffee. Unfortunately, I'd upped my order recently to three months at a time, so I now have another 107 weak cups of coffee to look forward to. But I'll be shopping for a new brand."
844,Usually I like Peelu and their chewing gums. The mint moxie not so much. Didn't like the crumbly texture and an off taste. Wouldn't recommend.
845,"I wasn't sure what to expect with a name like Soursop.  I was expecting the juice to be more on the tart side which I actually like, but this juice is very sweet and very tasty.  I also have high blood pressure and this juice actually relaxed me and gave me a warm feeling throughout my body.  I tested my blood pressure after drinking it and it was definitely lower than usual.  I've read in other forums that people with low blood pressure should use caution when drinking Soursop juice because it may lower their blood pressure to unsafe levels.  It really did relax me a bit and I drank it in the middle of the day.  I think from now on I will only drink it in the evening when all my work is done."
846,It's just okay nothing extraordinary or unique! I wouldn't order it again. Chocholate was okay but some almonds taste old:(
847,"Stash has done a fine packaging job on its organic green teas.Whether they are the gunpowder which I like(more fond of the Twinings gunpowder).<br />  That being said the Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green has to be ranked right up there with Rishi Jasmine.If you are familiar with Rishi.<br />  Republic of Tea Jasmine, is better than both of these.However if you are LQQking for a tea that is in a great package,easy to store,easy on the pocketbook and still delivers,then this is the one.Is it the greatest jasmine in the world,no of course not,but it is enough of a great tea for everyday drinking in and out all year long.<br />  Even the best of teas need some time off,but with this one i am never disappointed.<br />  Two minutes brew time at 175 temp, and it doesn't get bitter,and can make a second great cup minus the caffeine.Remember all the caffeine goes into the first cup.You can avoid the caffeine altogether by giving it a flush for 30 seconds in a cup of 175 degree water and then removing the brewing basket.Thanx"
848,"One of the best seasonings I've ever user, particulary for grilling meat and a little-known and scarcely available cut called a ""Tri-Tip."" Sprinkle liberally on both sides of the meat, refrigerate overnight and grill at high heat on both sides for 8-10 minutes, depending on thickness and desired finish."
849,The taste of Heinz Zesty Cocktail Sauce is heads above others I've purchased. This is the second bottle I've bought and I'm looking to buy my third.  This time I'll buy two so I don't run out.  I highly recommend the Heinz.
850,"These Green Mountain ""Caramel Vanilla Cream"" K-Cups make good tasting coffee, with noticeable but not overpowering caramel and vanilla flavors. These make a nice alternative to to our regular coffee (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a>, which we love) when we want something a little more dessert like.<br /><br />This is not the strongest coffee, but it is a nice treat and is good both hot or iced.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
851,"My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much."
852,"This is a good quality nori and the bamboo mat is a great bonus.  I've made 4 full sized maki rolls with it so far, and it performs very well.  Maybe a little too thick...but good tasting and well toasted."
853,"I had seen ghost chile's all over tv so being a hot food fanatic I had to buy some. I was not disappointed. I blended them up and put some in a hot sauce and it had a perfect heat. But unless it's with a lot of other flavors and cooked they are KILLER. I just chopped one up and put it in an omelete. After pounding my fist on the table through the battle, I proceeded to lay down on my couch for 2 hours unable to move while the heat consumed my innards and scorched my mouth. These are the real deal, and live up to the name 100%."
854,"Two Leaves and a Bud produces the most wonderful organic teas and this Assam Breakfast tea is lovely, strong and dark - perfect for a nice, big cup of tea anytime of day! If you like dark tea, you will like this one! And the bulk purchase is a really great deal!"
855,"As I type this, my crockpot is filled with Vege-Burger, kidney beans, onion, garlic, celery, carrot and spices. It smells fantastic in here! The Vege-Burger makes an extremely hearty chili, and the texture is perfect. I also use V-B for tacos and burritos and ""meat"" sauce for my pasta. This is a wonderfully versatile product, with a pleasant taste that takes on the flavor of the spices you use. It has great ""mouth feel"". The only caution I would give is that you need to use oil in the pan if you are going to sautee it, because it will stick to the pan. But that's not an issue with crockpots, of course."
856,"Positives:<br />* Doesn't use artificial sweeteners or corn syrup<br />* Affordable - this costs so much less than buying Gatorade or Powerade!<br />* Better for you! Lower in calories than the more popular sports drinks.<br />* Tastes good as far as I'm concerned. I like it better than the other sports drinks I've tried. Tastes like regular Crystal Light from what I remember.<br />* Doesn't require you to purchase plastic bottle after plastic bottle of product, thus reducing your carbon footprint! BONUS!<br />* Not much packaging and it's really convenient to carry in your purse if you're a female.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Yes it does use sugar which kind of sucks, but I find that it does cut the Stevia which can have a bitter taste sometimes. And the amount of sugar used really isn't that high.<br /><br />Tips:<br />* Make sure to read the instructions as I didn't and put the entire packet in a 16.9oz bottle my 1st time. It's very strong when you do this. The packet's intended for 2 servings.<br />* I've gotten used to drinking nothing but water over the years so you could play with this a bit and use more water than they recommend. I use a 33.8oz bottle per packet typically but intend on buying some BPA-free reusable bottles and just keeping them premade in the fridge for a moments notice."
857,"I bought some of these chocolates for my mother for her birthday.  I was a little scared about the quality since they were significantly cheaper than Godiva, etc...  BUT my mom (a chocolate connesieur) said that these were some of the best chocolates she has ever had!  If you're considering chocolates, go with these and save some $$--they are a great value!"
858,"Super-delicious chocolate-covered potato chips. Thickly coated, great balance of flavors. Came this time is 8oz bags, which makes it easier for us to eat only 8 oz at a time and keep the rest hidden until another celebration!"
859,"First, I would have been overjoyed to just give this 5 stars.  It's got good texture and flavor being slightly sweet with a meaty consistency.  It cooks perfectly in the microwave although I've never tried the boiling method.  I use it for all sorts of meal bases.  You could just eat it plain though.  It's that good.<br /><br />The batch I just went through though was a real trial to get into.  I've ordered this brand before with no troubles but this batch (all dozen) was a real pain to open.  You are supposed to just vent the lid by peeling it back slightly before you microwave it but that was pretty much impossible.  The seal between the top and the bowl was so strong, you just couldn't.  I ended up just cutting the top free.  I've got to tell you, microwave packaging isn't generally much of a challenge for me but this was.  Just beware it's possible that, if you have a physical infirmity, this packaging might be a challenge."
860,"Okay, I have a black lab that will eat almost anything...she rejects green peas, banana peels, most fruit and most trash.  I feel that it is important to tell you that, as she aids significantly in this review.  With that said, she does seem to really like this food.  We are pleased and will definitely consider it in the future.  I have no clue what a finicky dog's verdict would be.  This bag is a good size for a trial run though and there isn't a shelter out there that couldn't use the unused portion if you Fido decided it wasn't up to his standards.  Daisy liked it!"
861,"After having tried several other brands of Indian Spices, this one is definitely the best. Now I only buy this brand."
862,"I purchased the Butter Rum Coffee from Arbuckle's through Amazon.Com.<br />Arbuckle's called and said that flavor (Butter Rum) was no longer available.<br />We switched to another flavor and I could have gotten it ""cheaper"" by ordering<br />that flavor direct.  I really wanted Butter Rum and was willing to pay More for<br />that flavor instead of paying a higher price for a secondary flavor.  Unhappy!!!"
863,"The almonds were fresh and flavorful...a high quality product.  And the price was reasonable compared to health food stores and groceries. There were no 'bad' almonds in the whole bag.  It shipped quickly, too. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMFCXO"">Almonds Whole Natural 2lb (32 Ounces)</a>"
864,"One of the few ""meat"" snacks she really likes.  Can be a little expensive at times, but for a real treat this is really good."
865,"It's very disappointing that the original version of this is no longer available.  The ""2"" version, which I received, too, isn't nearly as good.<br /><br />I did contact Amazon CS by email and phone before ordering and they told me I'd get the right one, but I didn't.<br /><br />At this point, even though the ""2"" version isn't as good, I don't know of a better one, so I'll probably reorder now since I'm running low.<br /><br />Wrigley, please bring back the original!"
866,"These treats are excellent for training. My dogs love the (safe) peanut butter flavor. They come running when they hear the pouch open! A tad pricey, but worth it."
867,"I knew it would be too good to be true and honestly a lot of Hungry Girl recipes are hype and just plain taste bad. I'd rather eat WHAT I want in smaller portions than this substitute junk ever again. Can I have my $3 back?<br /><br />It's not that it tasted bad, there really wasn't any flavor. The liquid it's in IS fishy but I rinsed it several times in warm and cold water. I also boiled it for 3 minutes.<br /><br />It's the texture. It was gelatinous. It was firm yet squishy in the middle. I managed to swallow it down. My mother spit it out instantly. My aunt also swallowed it.<br /><br />It's ""interesting"" and I'm definitely not hooked on this product. This is strike 3 for HG, really. The VitaTops aren't worth what you pay, although they are OK and most of the flavors are good. However, the shipping is ridiculous. Her ""buffalo"" wings reminded me nothing of the buffalo wings I get.<br /><br />Buy whole wheat or whole grain noodles instead. Just eat a smaller portion."
868,"This is a great no-calorie replacement for Gatorade! Very refreshing, but I think its too sweet when added to a 16-oz bottle of water. I add one pack to a quart water bottle and it still tastes great!"
869,"We just returned from a vacation in Kauai and had this coffee, it is amazing. Smooth, no after taste, fresh roasted, a cup takes us back to the beautiful island that is Kauai."
870,"If you want a dark roast that nearly rivals espresso, here's your choice.<br />Don't get me wrong, it's not espresso, but it is a dark, rich, balanced, flavorful roast that I look forward to when I need a pick-me-up some mornings. If you like dark roasts, this is VERY VERY GOOD!"
871,"These treats are small and are perfect for training treats. Plus, my dog absolutely loves them. She can get distracted by other dogs when walking, but when I consistently use these as a reward, her behavior quickly changes for the better. Her trainer recommended making small cooked hot dog treats. I think these are just as attractive, but a lot healthier for her - and easier for me.<br /><br />Do use the bag seal. She doesn't like them nearly as well if they get dried out. I use a small ziploc snack bag to put some in when walking her."
872,"I discovered Skinner's Raisin Bran when I was a child, growing up in Ashland, KY.  It was the only raisin bran that didn't get soggy when I addded milk.  When I left Kentucky, I could not find Skinners anywhere.  Then I moved to Claremont, CA and for a few years, one of the health food stores carried it--and then it stopped.  On a whim, I checked the internet, and there it was.  Since then I hae been ordering 6 boxes every few months, and I love it.  It still remains crisp, fresh and yummy.  I am a grateful fan."
873,This soup is absolutely delicious.  Our whole family loves it.  It has the best flavor of any tomato soup I've ever tasted.  So much better & healthier than the canned tomato soup from the grocery store!
874,"We are pumpkin seed fanatics!  We can't wait for the 'season', so we can make our own.  I used David & Son's in the off-season because that's the only time we can get them.  We roast them further with some olive oil and pepper which gives them much better flavor... Unfortunately, the salt level is SO HIGH, your tongue curls up after just a few!  I called them to see if they were available 'roasted-NO or LOW salt added', then we could control.. nope.  They were very cool on the phone and offered coupons in the mean time along with passing along the desire for no-low salt added versions.  That was cool... but until then... I'm trying to soak them in water first to see if i removes some of the salt.. I'll let you know how it goes.... stay tuned..."
875,"My mother loves this coffee and the pods fit her coffee maker. It is hard to find pods that do work for it, so we have a standing order for this brand. She can have one or two cups, and go on her way. You just can't beat the ease!"
876,"These clusters are fresh, crunchy, with just enough sweetness to enjoy eating by the handful. It doesn't have that typical oily taste that you get from other granola makers. Instead you get a clean tasting and healthy treat. Low in sodium and sugar, and best of all no saturated or trans fat! Highly recommend!"
877,"Yes, the cans are cheaper but it would be more honest if the ad had stated that the cans are dented. I have received shipments where the whole set was dented. It was pretty obvious that they were not dented in the same incident. The stew itself was not affected but it would just be more honest if the advertisement had stated that these did not pass quality inspection."
878,"Tried this syrup and love it!!!  It tastes like the real thing.  Well,  maybe very close would be the real comparison.  We have tried several of the sugar free syrup's and this one is by far the best one out there.  Not only does it have great flavor it also has the consistancy of real syrup,not a watery imitation.  Try it you'll love it.  Many of our friends are now using this syrup as well.  Thanks for a great product.  Free shipping is super too!!!!"
879,"My 11 year old cat has just undergone her second thyroid lobe surgery, and her appetite has been waning even though I have been feeding her another premium canned food.  I bought a small can of Tiki ""tuna on rice with crab surimi"" and waved it under her nose tonight and she literally jumped to her feet and ran to her feeding station.  She's now a member of the clean plate club even with a small bit of medication mixed in.  I'm sold!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C23RS6"">Tiki Cat Honolulu Luau Tuna On Rice with Crab Surimi Canned Cat Food</a>"
880,"I have been buying Purely O's for the past few years.  Yes, I was paying a premium, however it was worth it.  The ingredients were organic, these was a decent fiber content, and most importantly, there was no corn or sugar.  Recently General Mills (company that owns Cascadian Farms)decided to covertly change the formula, add a bunch of sugar and corn, and pass it off as the same cereal.  I opened the box and thought that that there was a packaging mix-up.  I thought they put the Honey O's in the Purely O's box.  I called the customer service number (which I have never done before) to let them know.  To my surprise I was told that it was not a mixup, and that they had changed the formula.  I was stunned.  I had finally found a fortified cereal without all of the junk in it that I liked.  Now it is just another overpriced mainstream sugar cereal.  Obviously General Mills is trying to maximize profits by cheapening the ingredients in their line of foods.  Poor form in my opinion.  I agree with the other reviews.  At the very least, inform people.  They have lost me as a Purely O's customer, and I question whether or not I can trust the brand in general.  Don't bother with this cereal.  It's no longer worth the premium you need to pay."
881,"Not having time to make great stocks for cooking, I looked high and low for a product that would be like home made.  I finally found it with this product.  It is truly wonderfui, just the aroma when you open a packet smells so wonderful.  I have passed these on to friends and family and now none of them will cook with out them.  I highly recommend giving them a try, you won't want anything else once you have."
882,"this is the third popchips box i ordered on Amazon. The box in the box was crushed by a toaster, the chips are really no more fun to eat."
883,"I was a little hesitant about ordering this syrup as I have been disappointed with other brands.  No need.  This is excellent, and I plan to order more of this flavor as well as other flavors from this maker."
884,i wouldn't have bought had i known it use artificial sweetener... it has a horrible after taste - also not strong enough - only makes a 6 oz cup.
885,Good size pieces of freeze dried liver.  Few small bits or dust common in some other brands.  Resealable bag is handy.
886,Love the texture and taste of these crackers!  They are great alone or with cheese.  Yum Yum!
887,"These are extremely thin, delicate cookies. They are delicious, but I will not order them from Amazon again. I sent them as a gift and my friend reported that only half the cookies weren't broken. Almost half of them were reduced to crumbs, and a few were broken into pieces large enough to handle. They were sent in a box with no padding, just a couple of air-filled bags, one of which was completely deflated. Such a disappointment!"
888,"I have 6 cats, all rescue and it's been really hard to find a food that all of them will eat, but they all love Fussie Cat.  From the research I've done, it's a high quality food, manufactured in a human food plant.  This is one food that a human can look at an actually identify as fish and/or chicken. I buy all three flavors for my fur kids and have it on the subscription plan now.  I used to buy it at a pet food warehouse many miles away.  With the Amazon subscription plan (and free Prime shipping) it's cheaper to have it delivered to my front door and I can speed up or delay delivery according to my needs, too.  Fussie Cat is a winner in my house."
889,All the flavors are great! I wish they were bigger portions and a bit cheaper tho.<br />But a great alt to real jerky!
890,My dogs love these treats.  They beg for them and sometimes I sprinkle these treats on top of their food for a special treat.  Also Amazon ships very fast so I get them quickly.
891,"I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is."
892,"We've had this flavor on subscribe and save for a couple of years now, and despite trying many other K-cups, this one remains my wife's favorite.<br /><br />I find it has a pleasant flavor, on the milder side, and while I prefer my coffee a little more feisty, I've never minded drinking this one when it was the only flavor we had left in the pantry."
893,"We've had the Senseo coffee maker for a few years now and really enjoy the coffee.  I like the dark roast (purchased) and my wife enjoys the decaf.  It seems other competitors are gaining ground in the local stores and the Senseo coffee pods are less and less easy to find.  Or, if you find them they are priced higher than usual.  We're really glad we located this product and vendor online through Amazon.  Hopefully, our Senseo coffee machine will continue to last and the pods will continue to be made available.  The only ""complaint"" we've ever had is that the decaf flavors are very limited.  Otherwise, love the coffee!"
894,This  is the best coffee to wake up to in the morning!  Is not bitter just right.  Enjoyed by all who it is served to.
895,My daughter will grab a bag for a snack as we are on the go somewhere and before I know it she has finished the entire bag!  It is a once bag but there is lots of fruit in it and the strawberry pouches are over-flowing which is nice for a change!
896,"I won't be finishing this.  I'm not sure if it's the quality of the tea itself or the quality of the spices added to it.  I tried 4 bags and ended up with a lousy cup of tea with a hint of spice and a bad aftertaste every time.  I was expecting pumpkin pie spice.  Maybe cinnamon?  Nutmeg? A little cloves? Ginger?  I, nor any of the people I shared this with detected any of that, one said it tasted like a rotten pumpkin before even seeing the bag or the box, does that count?  I'm no tea snob, this just absolutely didn't do it for any of us, straight or sweetened.  I figured this was a sure bet, and foolishly ordered this 6 pack.  Don't make that mistake, try one box first!"
897,This is the same brand we buy at the grocery store but Amazon brings it to me at a much better price.
898,"ALL MY CATS ENJOY THIS CAT FOOD BEST FELINE FRIEND CANNED CAT FOOD, TUNA TOO COOL RECIPE.  THEY FINISH ALL THEIR FOOD, IT IS A CAT FOOD SIMILAR TO FANCY FEAST CLASSIC VARIETY, BUT IT IS A NICE CHANGE FOR MY CATS, AND A NUTRITIOUS CHANGE FOR THEM.  THEY FINISH ALL THIS FOOD TO THE LAST BITE.  I PLAN TO BUY MORE AND TRY THE OTHER VARIETIES OF BEST FELINE FRIEND CANNED CAT FOOD."
899,"I'm a fan of all kinds of teas so it's easy to give them a thumbs up.  The single pouches are what I use to take with me to work or camping which cuts down on space AND lets me share with others easier.  Great product at home or on the go for sure.  They do have strings, staples and paper tags which is why I only gave it a 4 star.  Eliminate those wasteful parts and they're a five star for sure."
900,"I like to eat smoked oysters straight out of the can or on a cracker. Unfortunately these petite, little darling are inconstant from can to can. Some cans have firm oysters in them while others cans are full of chewy and crunchy oysters. The aroma of the smokey oysters come on pretty strong and so does the taste.<br /><br />I probably won't be ordering any more unless the price comes downs."
901,great stuff. used for baking. I mix it with cinnamon then coat almonds and roast them.  a sweet delicious treat with calories only from the almonds.  use it instead of sugar in any recipe.
902,this hot coca tastes pretty good when brewed on 8oz setting however its not the best I've ever tasted nor the worst. its hard to rate this because everyone has different tastes so its ether you like it or you don't. I my self happen to like it and will buy again unless I find something better.
903,This candy was made in Germany. It was very good. It is made of dark chocolate and marzipan.
904,I recently bought 4 different boxes of the K-Cups and I ALWAYS find myself popping this one in. The flavor is crazy good and I was completely surprised when I tasted the creamer that was thrown in. I love it. I love it a lot.
905,"I go down to my local grocery store to pick up a snack....HMMM...roasted almonds sound good. So, I got'em. To my disappointment, they were roasted alright...with a glaze of garlic...YUK!!!!! Nowhere on the label does it specify ""GARLIC"" or any other flavor. The packaging appeared to represent plain ole roasted - no salt - almonds. Geez!! What a bummer!!! Now...no snack cuz I aint eat'n no garlic almonds.  This packaging is very misleading.  Unless you dig garlic, stay away from these."
906,"We decided to try this dogfood because it was a few dollars cheaper than the Iams weight control that we normally buy.  We have spent FAR more than those few dollars in paper towels and cleaning supplies.  I guess because of the name, we thought it was a premium dog food.  If it is, it is the worst stuff we have ever tried.  I would go back to a cheap brand before ever buying this stuff again.  The dogs may lose weight, but if so, the dehydration from the diarrhea is a much worse consequence.  I expected some digestive problems with the change, but it has been almost 2 weeks, and no change in the problem.  I had to go to the store and buy our usual.  I wont even set this stuff out where stray dogs can get it.  Lesson Learned!"
907,"This is the best cornbread I've ever had, and it is good for you too. Great corn flavor, quick preparation, stays moist, and still tastes great if you don't have honey and substitute a little sugar instead. I lived in Texas for several decades, ate many different types of cornbread, and this is my favorite. My local Health Food store stopped carrying this mix several months ago so I tried making cornbread with Arrowhead Mills corn meal, but as excellent as that product is, the finished cornbread just wasn't as good! I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a good price, too."
908,"When using a drip coffee maker, I often slipped in an extra spoonful of grounds to make my morning coffee extra strong so that the milk would not dilute it too much.  After recently having bought a Keurig, I was a bit disappointed at the somewhat watered-down light-bodied taste of most of the K-Cups which came as a sample with it.<br /><br />So my first inclination was to browse the Amazon reviews of several varieties of K-Cup coffee and take advantage of what others who like a nice strong bold cup of coffee had learnt by trial and error - and that was a good move!  I took you all at your word, ordered a 50-pack of this coffee on Monday, had my first cup of it this morning, and decided it was worth submitting my first ever review of any Amazon product ever, both to give it a 5-star rating myself and to thank those of you who take the time & trouble to give honest reviews for the benefit of people like me.<br /><br />So for the record, on a price and quality scale this is my new favourite K-Cup coffee.  Until now, my favourite on a pure quality scale was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008C9QEVU"">Starbucks Caff&egrave; Verona, Dark Roast, 27-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> (excellent but very pricey!) and for a bold-yet-affordable cup was <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I3I4"">Green Mountain Coffee Double Black Diamond, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers 24-Count</a> (also excellent, and less pricey, but IMO not quite as nice in flavour as Emeril's ""Big Easy Bold"").<br /><br />For anyone looking for a nice strong full-bodied and flavourful K-Cup coffee which won't break the bank, do try this one. If you're like me you won't be disappointed."
909,"Have used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning for many years. Although I have tried others, nothing compares to this one. I have used it only on fish."
910,"This pink salt has a very nice subtle flavor. I didn't know salt could vary in flavor until I tried this one. We bought the salt initially because (a) it's organic and (b) my daughter wanted pink salt! But the flavor is what really made the difference. I don't know much about salt, but I want to say that this has a ""rounded"" flavor meaning it isn't harsh or distinctive on food, rather it seems to become part of the food, going in and bringing back the flavor of the food in an enhanced way. Sounds silly, but I am learning good quality ingredients really make a difference."
911,"True Himalayan Pink Salt.  I won't bore you with all the wonderful benefits of this mineral-rich salt.  I'll figure you won't be here if you aren't already aware of them.<br /><br />This is excellent, rich, pink salt.  It is ground very well, and is suitable for use as both kitchen and table salt. It has a nice flavor and works perfectly in all our recipes. If you plan to store it in a shaker, you want to add some uncooked rice in with it, or it will lump badly.  It is very fine, so it absorbs all the moisture, without rice to help it.<br /><br />We love the quality of this brand, and will buy more, and more. :)"
912,"Not only is this some very tasty coffee, Amazon offers it at a very good price.  I'm quite pleased with this purchase and can recommend it to others with no reservation."
913,"I am not sure how I am going to write 20 words about this - it is good coffee and I enjoy drinking it. I even drank it during the spring, which is not the usual time to be drinking this autumn-like beverage. It does not taste as good as a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks (what does? those are so good!), but it is an improvement over standard coffee for when you want something different in my opinion. I am happy I bought this and would recommend it."
914,"My cat loves these treats. Whenever she sees the bag, or hears it crinkles, she starts to meow. She has a hairball problem, and these treats help with that."
915,"It's a good snack for when I don't have time to run out and get something to eat. I know it's bad for you, but it tastes so good."
916,"My 15 year old loves, I mean adores this treat! I can be assured that she's getting joint nutrients at the same time. Wish it were made in the USA. Maybe some day soon we'll have our own product."
917,"This is a great alternative healthy sweetener. Just takes a little experimentation to figure the best ratio to substitute for sugar in different things. The best part about this is the amazing price on Amazon. In the store the small 8 or 10 ounce bottles sell for about $7, so for just over double the price you get 10 times the sweetener - and I don't have to leave the house!"
918,"This has got to be the worst chopped garlic I have ever used, and I've been cooking over 50 years!  It's like a paste rather than chopped, with a consistency of pudding. The worst part is the garlic explodes like popcorn when you saute it in oil. It shoots oil and garlic about a foot in the air and, if you do not cover the pan, it will burn you. It even explodes in prepared foods that need to be fried, like meatballs. KEEP AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
919,"I used these for a dark and white chocolate dipped madelaines. I tried to put them one by one with a very fined tip tweezer and was impossible. They stick together and can't be used for a design. However, as a decorative piece alltogether it was pretty."
920,"My bog loves these dental chews more than any other treat I have ever given him.  As a bonus they seem to give my dog better smelling breath.  Just so that it doesn't take you by surprise, they will turn your dog's poop a darker shade because of the coloring.<br /><br />I highly recommend these."
921,"Beautiful roses to gift specially to the near ones, Amazon people made my day by delivering the product on time i am really thankful to them ..<br />  This is a perfect gift to give to the<br />one who is close to you ...."
922,My dog loves Greenies Treats and because they are good fo rher that makes them even better!
923,Compared to other vendors this was by far the least expensive and the shipping was fair and fast.
924,"This peanut butter is so much better than ordinary supermarket peanut butter, that it should have a new name so it's not confused with normal PB&J spread.  I was doubtful that it could be much different the first time I tried it, but wow, was I wrong!  It really is THAT good!.  I am so glad that I was able to find it on Amazon.com, but it's good enough to be worth the trip to Williamsburg."
925,"I'm a fan of Tully's in my Keurig, and coming up with an evening brew has rounded out the single cup beauty of the machine.  If you like the ""medium roast"" type of coffees, this one will please, as you hardly notice any difference in flavor except that you know that only the caffeine is missing.  It's really nice to enjoy a late night brew without the fear of a sleepless night.  Good, smooth, bold flavor, one of the best I have tried so far.  Amazon service is great as always.  The double pack saves money, and stocks the shelf as well.  I'll reorder when the first box is gone, its that good."
926,"I didn't read the product info very carefully before buying it, and didn't realise that one had to add oil, water and an egg. It doesn't save much more time than making the mix from scratch, therefore, but it tastes good."
927,Nothing like Boston Fruit slices. Delicious isn't even the right word for how good they are. I'm not sure what flavor Watermelon is but they got it down good. I'm totally addicted to all the flavors. YUMMY!!!!
928,"Hands down the best meal replacement available, period.<br />Best taste, NOT a watery consistency, and most filling / nutritionally whole.<br />A regular staple for those times I don't have it to cook a real breakfast."
929,This was a very weak tasting product. It was a watered down hot chocolate at best. I was hoping that it would be an Organo Gold product that I would enjoy. I will not purchase it again.
930,I have been looking for a gluten free granola bar. I found this one and I it tastes great....
931,"I do see flying moths in my house and I put up the traps but not one went into the traps.  Still catch them by clapping my hands.  So far the traps have been a total waste of money.  Sorry to say!!!!!.......  They sell moth paper, which comes in folded up strips, in Europe which are very effective.  Amazon sells them in Europe.  Why are they not sold here?????"
932,"My cat has been having some health problems, and I have to make sure he eats so he can take his medicine.  After spending the day at the vets, he had no interest in food.  I sprinkled Foodie Cat on his wet food and it was instant...he chowed it all down.  I've also used it to get him to ingest a crushed up pill that I had put on top of his food.<br /><br />It works great!  Cats are crazy for it.<br /><br />Thank you Foodie Cat!"
933,"I ordered the supplement after realizing that pumping at work wasn't producing as much as I needed to cover what my 3-month old daughter drank at daycare, and I'm committed to exclusively breastfeeding for as long as the AAP recommends.  Currently I take two capsules with every meal (6 a day).  I began to notice increased engorgement probably about 48 hours after starting the supplement.  Since starting it, I've been pumping about 3-4 ounces more per day, which is enough to cover the gap I had been concerned about.  Although I myself was a bit gassy for the first few days, I didn't notice any side effects in my daughter (and I was definitely watching out for them).<br /><br />I should say, I had to stop taking the pills for a few days due to some minor surgery, and I did notice my supply go down again.  So the pills do work, but in my case at least I have to keep taking them to keep getting results.  I'm happy to do it for my baby :)"
934,"Just be warned that after you take a bite or two, you'll really want to eat the entire bag in one sitting. It gets 1-star short of perfection from me because some of the packages have less chocolate-covered popcorn than others. It's the dark chocolate that is fantastic."
935,"I must state, I am not a drinker and do not use ANY type of drug nor do I smoke. I drink clean bottled/pure well water, locally grown and squeezed fruit juice, an occasional fake (generic) Mtn Dew, and am 60+ years old.<br /><br />I choked down all flavors in a 12-pack of assorted bottles and am of the humble opinion that they all taste like sparkling skunk urine. I wish this could be in a more positive vein but there is no doubt in my mind - this stuff is wretched."
936,My little pom absolutely loves the Greenies Dental Chews. Amazon provides the bigger pack of 96 at a cheaper price than you can find in stores. When they arrived today I told my dog her treats were here and she knew exactly what I was talking about. She was jumping up and down and could hardly wait for me to open the package. As soon as I got it opened she grabbed her little Greenie and went to town!!
937,"I excitedly bought this sauce before I realized that this is a California company posing as an Italian exporter of real San Marzano tomato products.<br /><br />It was simply awful. I paid 7 dollars for a jar of sauce that was no better than Ragu.<br /><br />I usually make my own sauce, but since I 'thought' that I was buying something made with actual San Marzano tomoatoes, I decided to try it.<br /><br />At the same time, I bought their canned tomatoes. Just the worst!<br /><br />If you can't get the real thing, such as La Bella or other real Italian brands, stick wth Progresso."
938,"Now my kids don't ever have cool-aid type drinks, so to them, this taste like a treat!  We take this every day (I only do a 1/2 scoop, to last longer, with 3 kids!) and it has done a world of good for us (along with a powder probiotic, buffered Vit C powder -with magnesium and stuff like that-- and glutamine powder) we do this power drink )using mostly water, and a little apple juice) and my kids have been healthy ALL WINTER!  This has never happened before.  We are pretty healthy eaters, no sweets, etc. but this is truly amazing!!!  (I have a first grader, and 2 preschoolers).  HIGHLY recommend this .  Oh, and we are also very sensitive to different foods (gluten, dairy, etc) but eating this before we eat those foods helps them to be not so sensitive!"
939,"if you have a golden whose hair tends to smell, this product will significantly reduce the problem. When I adopted my golden, she was extremely overweight and she didn't smell that great. After a few weeks of eating this dog food which was recommended by a friend, she began to lose weight and smell better. It is now about a year and a half later and she's in great shape and smells like a dog. The product does not contain any corn."
940,My little pupster loves these things. She is not exactly Ms. easy to please when it comes to food of any kind. These she thinks are great.<br /><br />Betsy
941,"I have occasionally joked that this is drinkable heroin. When a really good ""malted"" is served to me, my eyes tend to cross as my lips embrace the straw and I will sometimes not stop sucking on the straw until that awful slurp at  the bottom sounds off indicating my fix is ended. I have used Horlicks in the past and it's quite good, but I still consider Carnation as the real thing. I've had some ""no-name"" syrups and I believe another brand used to be available in the US, but they were useless.<br /><br />I do think there's something genetic about my love of malt (just as I despise okra or green peppers). With this apparent withdrawal of Carnations from the supermarket shelves, it's obvious that the malted thing needs to be revitalized. Young versions of ""ME"" who have this genetic preference are waiting for this ultimate ""comfort food"" be a popular item once again."
942,"I am so thrilled to see these products! As a person who lives with celiac, thank you Betty Crocker for mainstreaming gluten free products! I would like to see a mixed group of the 4 products available, such as 1 of each of the cake mixes, 2 brownie mixes, and 2 cookie mixes."
943,"I saw the Just Add Juice advertised and wanted to give it a try.  BBQ sauce is so loaded with sugar that our family can no longer eat it due to dietary restrictions.  This is a wonderful alternative.  We found a lower sugar apple juice and used that in conjunction with the packet, following the instructions.  Our first attempt we marinaded for only about 30 minutes.  It had a very light flavor.  The second attempt we marinaded for around 5-6 hours and it was just right.  We have also tried the tequilla-lime flavor which is outstanding.  I'd give this one 4 stars and the tequilla-lime 5 stars.  I'd definately buy this product again."
944,"The herb kit I received with the Aerogarden unit was unimpressive.<br /><br />Most of the seeds failed to germinate.<br /><br />I have had no problems with their cherry tomato kit, which have grown about 2 inchs in only 9 days."
945,My favorite of flavored coffees! All types of Gloria Jeans coffee are wonderful and definitely recommended. :)
946,"I can tell this is a great oatmeal. It's thick, chewy, wholesome, filling but does not feel like a lead weight in your stomach. However, there is a slight stale smell when opening each can and if you eat them without brown sugar or honey you can taste that staleness. I would not buy them from amazon again as it seems they were kept around too long. You can get them for $5 a can at Trader Joe's I noticed today. I think the turnover there would be faster so will be doing that from now on. Great product though!"
947,"What they fail to mention to everyone is the fact that the candy is all for the decade it was created in. My first piece of candy was an orange tootsie roll. When I bit down I almost broke my teeth it was so rock hard. The product may have been better if it wasn't so old. I also discovered that the small box that I thought was stuffed to the top with candy has paper filler in the bottom. Most of this ""hard to find"" candy can be found at Walmart and various other places for much cheaper prices."
948,"I've tried at least eight different kinds of k-cups not including all the horrible free ones you get in the box.  Normally the coffee is weak.  THIS one finally comes close to that Starbucks flavor -- if you like a more pungent, burnt flavor that you get with European dark roasts.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  And they sell it at Target now!"
949,"My dog trainer recommended this to our obedience class. I found the best price here on Amazon, and my puppy LOVES the treats. Great training treats if used in moderation (too much organ meat isn't good for anyone). Also excellent if you put some of the treats in a container with non-liver treats/cookies. Use the container as a shaker to help train your dog to come, and the other treats get a liver flavored (dust) coating that makes your dog love them even more! No limit on liver dusted treats!<br /><br />Two paws up for this stuff!"
950,"I love this product, but I live in Alaska and I hate the fact that they won't ship here!"
951,"... then these strips are for you.  A friend of mine introduced me to them, and admittedly, they taste pretty good, but the seitan has a color and texture that will make you think you are eating human flesh.  It's horrifying, and yet afterwards you'll be craving more, which is all the more horrifying.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for taste, 1 star for cannibalism... 3 stars overall."
952,My son love's Enjoy Life cookies. He has so many allergies that these were the only brand I could find that he could and would eat. I go through 2-3 boxes a week and its worth it for him to have a snack that he loves to eat.
953,"I love this syrup.  What I like about it best is that it combines both agave and vanilla together thereby not having to deal with buying the raw vanilla separately, which can expensive, or blending agave with vanilla powder, which can be hard and even impossible depending on how you are using it.  Best of all, the taste is awesome.  Very delicious and easy to use.  A real winner for me."
954,This hot chocolate has been a favorite of my family's for at least 5 years. It has a smooth chocolate taste with a hint of cinnamon.  It is irresistible and great for gift giving.
955,"Let me first say that the packaging looks different than what it shows on the website. It looks and feels antiquated. But what matters is what is inside, correct?<br />I tasted essential against 3 other waters. One was a simply filtered water (from refrigerator disperser), another had minerals added- bottled water, and the other one was tap water (which tastes different depending on what part of the country and even in different municipalities).<br />Lets just say that essentia won...here are the differences from worst to best:<br />- Tap water: let's just say its like taking a big gulp of pool water...you know that chlorinated taste.<br />- regular bottled water (from local non-spring source, reverse osmosis, destilled, and minerals added): it's tasted like any other bottled water. It's ok and this should be the base standard.<br />- Filtered water (from my refrigerator): I might be biased but the filter does a good at removing chlorine and particulate without removing some minerality, it tastes fresh and clean.<br />- Essentia (aka, the winner): the mouthfeel is smooth and it coats your mouth, it doesn't weight heavy on you, I guess this might be the electrolytes or PH balance. It was pleasant and reminds me of spring water but not necessarily ""refreshing"". I believe it will serve its purpose vs some of the sports drinks out there.<br />The other thing that bothered me was all the health claims that they make. I guess you could make those for water in itself. At the end of the day I would go for natural spring water over any other source/method of bottled water."
956,Made great treats although some of the pez candies were broken up when opened up to put in dispensers
957,I was looking for a high quality dog food which is affordable for my two dogs. I liked the ingredient list as well as the nutrient content on this brand. I haven't really heard of the brand before but did a search on it and found some favorable reviews. My dogs really love it and it seems like the amount listed on the package to feed (based on weight) seems to satisfy them.  They are not extremely active so I have to watch their weight. Also there seems to be not a lot of waste (yard clean-up) associated with the food which tells me it doesn't have tons of fillers. Overall I think this is a quality food and a great buy.
958,"I have lost a total of 63 pounds since June of 2010.  I have used the meal replacement bars for two meals a day and then a regular meal at night.  I have tried all of the favors and the only one that I do not particulary care for is the strawberry.  Since I have a sweet tooth and I love chocolate, the others are all very tasty.  I have not gotten tired of the meal replacement bars at all.<br /><br />I would recommend these bars to anyone trying to follow a diet."
959,My pet rabbit basically potty trained himself in a couple of days. I have 6 pans with two gray sifting trays. I place small triangular wedges of wood in the 4 corners of the pan. Then spread out a thin layer of cat litter. Then I place the sifting pan to rest on the wooden wedges. This keeps the sifter surface above the litter by about 1 inch. The rabbit drops his raisins that fall between the grade making it very easy to take the sifter out and hose it down in the yard. I take the spoiled litter pan with its contents and place those into a plastic bag I get from the super market when I go shopping. I tie the bag up with the spent litter and it goes outside to the waste bin. I hose down the litter sifter and pan every other day. The sifter does a great job of protecting the sensitive feet of rabbits. Rabbits are very clean animals and don't like to be near too soiled litter.
960,"These are good.  They are truly roasted and have that roasted flavor.  I would have given more stars if they weren't packed in water.  I was surprised at that.  I ended up draining the peppers thoroughly and putting in ziplock quart bags in the fridge.  Of course, only used one can because these are the big cans.  I use a bag at a time, saute in olive oil just to heat through with the herbs and spices that I intend for the meal. Excellent w/ Italian and other sausages and also had a cold pepper + olive oil salad.  I used one entire can within a week and a half for several good meals and it certainly saved time during this hot summer not having to roast and clean my own!"
961,"I wish I would have heeded another reviewer's comments about this product not tasting good. She was right. Sometimes the majority is wrong! These are not like Honey Grahams, and in fact, they have very little ""graham"" taste (actually just pretty flavorless overall). They are not ""light and crispy"" as the package states. Instead, they are thick and crunchy--probably excellent for a toddler cookie to be knawed on over time, especially since there is hardly any sweetness to them. However, since I am not a toddler and my taste buds already know what a graham cracker should taste like, these fell way short.<br />They sound healthy though, if that is exclusively what you are looking for--or if you like foods with very little flavor. The package says that the Amaranth flour that these contain along with wheat flour, has a bunch of nutrients not found in other flours. I'm still trying ways to make them palatable for ingestion (dipping in milk-they don't even get soggy, slathering stuff on top of them, etc.). Thankfully, my dogs like them.<br />Sadly, Amazon will not allow these to be returned, so I am stuck with six boxes. I called Health Valley on their ""customer promise of satisfaction"", and to their credit, while they could not replace the case, they did offer to send coupons for other HV items to compensate.<br /><br />I'd suggest you try to find them in a grocery and try one box to see if you like them before ordering the case."
962,It is packaged very well for shipping with one small box inside of the other larger box. All of mine arrived undamaged. It is absolutely delicious. I am very happy with how it tastes. I am using it to sweeten everything that I normally used sugar or any other sweeteners for. I bought it on subscribe and I have no regrets. It is much cheaper here than anywhere else I have seen it locally.
963,"I have tasted a number of different kale chips, and I must say this is the very best out of all of them. If you love chocolate, you'll love these! It satisfies a sweet-tooth craving for sure!!"
964,I love Chai Tea.  I don't even put sugar or honey in my Chai Tea.  This was just not right.  Tasted burnt out of the keurig and the cloves are overpowering.  No amount of honey and milk could make this right for me.  I am suffering through my 24-pack and may just throw it out.  Very disappointing.  I've had this brand/flavor in the bags before (although not recently) and liked it just fine.  Even bought it multiple times.  Not sure what is not working right with the k-cup formula.
965,"The product is not bad, but must brew at smallest cup size or it has no flavor.  Definitely an aftertaste. Watery."
966,"This is the best dry catfood I have tried to date.  A friend recommended it and I can't praise it enough.  So good I was initially using it as cat treats to teach tricks while I was transitioning from their old food.  This is grain-free with stellar ingredients and is sold for decent price by Amazon and most of the better online pet stores (petfooddirect, Mr. Chewy, etc.).  Good stuff and worth every penny - and doesn't cost any more than the cheap stuff in the long run because with this you are feeding quality not quantity."
967,"if you like strong coffee you will like this, it is strong but smooth and i do not drink any other kind"
968,This is my favorite cereal.  Can't find it in the store so this it's really great to get this on the Save & Subscribe program at a really good price.
969,"I love this product. I like some of the other flavors, but this one is the very best. Like mashed potatoes in a chip...and it's hard not to eat the whole bag. And let me tell you, if you do that at least they are healthier than the other options. I couldn't find my favorite flavor in my area though. I found the other flavors (sour cream & onion, cheddar, barbeque & original), but not my favorite. So I went this route & couldn't be happier. Yum! But these are MY chips...get your own. :-)"
970,"Have been a Maxwellhouse coffee drinker (Maxwellhouse lite) for 30 years.  Got tired of the bland tasting black water.  Bought the Breville smart grinder, the Bunn VP-17 and the 8 O'Clock coffee 50% decaf.  Now coffee drinking is a whole different world.  Got it all from Amazon in 2 days.  Best place to purchase these."
971,"I have been looking for Amazon to start carrying the Van Houtte K cups. I have been spending more just to get these flavors and now I just hope Amazon adds some of them to the subscribe and save program. Creme Brulee tastes just like having a Creme Brulee with a nice cup of coffee. I am impressed with how these k cups taste exactly like the name. This coffee is not over whelmingly sweet and has just a hint of flavor. It is a medium bodied, smooth coffee. If you like Creme Brulee and you like coffee, you have to try this. You will not be disapointed."
972,Very chocolate and raspberry just like the name says. Buy it and enjoy it. Smooth way to start your day.
973,"I'm a really big fan of Kenyan coffee and this did not dissapoint.  I found the flavor to be quite pleasing.  Although I still find that I prefer the freshly roasted whole beans I purchase from ""Whole Foods Markets"" but this hits the spot for my Keurig."
974,"About five years ago, we adopted a 6 year old chihauhau/pug/pekinese/guinea pig (just kidding) mix that had terrible teeth.  After having them cleaned by the vet under anesthesia (sp??), the vet recommended we give him this brand of chewies to help keep those expensively-cleaned choppers shiney.<br /><br />I am not sure exactly what is different about these than other brands, but they sure seem to do the trick.  We have had dogs in the past that used cheaper brands of various chewies, and I don't think they actually did much as far as really keeping the teeth clean.  Five years later, this dog's teeth are still nice and tidy and he has not had to have them re-cleaned by the vet.  (And if I remember right, it was almost 300 bucks to have him do it!)<br /><br />Though the dog mentioned could possibly use the smaller chews, we have 2 other dogs (a border terrier mix and a Walker coonhound/retriever mix), and when I get this size, it seems they can all share one bag and do okay.<br /><br />I recommend these if you have a dog with tartar problems specifically, but really, these seem to do a nice job keeping any dogs teeth free of ick!<br /><br />(Side note-- the chihauhau mix that I spoke of used to have seizures now and then-- maybe 5 or 6 a year-- that the vet could not find a cause for.  Since having his teeth cleaned, he has had only 3 seizures in the last 5 years.  I can't say for sure that his dental hygiene played a part in this, but it does seem a strange coincidence!)"
975,The first time I tried this tea in the Japanese restaurant and fell in love to it.<br />It is my favorite tea.... I love it!
976,"This is a good price for wild rice.  The packages are individually wrapped, about 2-3 cups of rice in each bag. You get a box of twelve bags.  One bag makes a good sidedish for a family of 4 or five.  The rice cooks fairly quickly so you do need to watch that it doesn't overcook and get mushy.  If it does overcook not to worry, add sauteed mushrooms and onions, and a little half/half or cream and make a really easy and delicious mushroom and wildrice soup."
977,My son loves strawberry Nesquik and we always seem to be running out of it.  I was thrilled when I found out I could buy it in bulk from Amazon.  The problem?  We live in the Midwest and this is not the same formula that I buy here at the grocery store.  The color of this Nesquik bought from Amazon is a bright neon pink and smells different from the strawberry Nesquik that I buy from a local store.  I didn't mention the difference to my 3 1/2 year old when I gave him some milk made with this strawberry Nesquik (made in Mexico?) and he immediately gave me the drink back and said he didn't like it and that it tasted bad.  Buyer beware!  This cannot be returned because it's a grocery item...nothing like throwing 15 bucks directly into the garbage!
978,"I'm pretty new to the coffee scene, but I really like this roast. It is quite flavorful and rich. It was the first coffee I bought, I tried a few more and I came back to this."
979,"The package said that you must pre-soak the noodles for five minutes (or whatever length of time it was) before boiling the noodles. Not necessary. My wife and I, on two occasions, just dumped some into boiling water, kept an eye on it, drained them after a period or time, and ate them.<br /><br />They were fine. They were not earth-shatteringly delicious, but then again many things that comes in bags are not. It was good, fine, adequate, serviceable, non-regrettable and I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />The instructions on the back are rather odd though. It gave me the impression that there are a limited number of recipes/dishes with which you can make these noodles, most involving top-of-the-line seafood. Again, unnecessary fuss. I think we had this with some plain Jane vegetables and seasoning. Turned out to be a nice dinner. I don't think my kids liked it, but that's kids for you.<br /><br />ADDITIONAL NOTE: I found the bag, so here's the nutritional information -<br /><br />Serving size: 56gm (2oz)<br />Serving size per container: 3.5<br />Calories: 209<br />Total Fat: 0.8g (Saturated fat: 0.3g, no trans fats)<br />Sodium: 2.4mg<br />Potassium: 3.3mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 47.1g (Fiber: 0.6g, Sugars: 2.2g, Protein: 3.2g)<br />DAILY VALUES: Vitamin C = 0.3%<br />Calcium = 1.4%<br />Iron = 3.2%<br />No vitamin A<br /><br />Ingredients: Brown rice, sago starch and water"
980,You have the wrong #of tea bags listed-- if you look closely there are twenty listed on the outside of the box!! Please change your listing--other than that the Refresh is delicious and invigorating!
981,We bought this product at the recomendation of our vet. It helps our cats dental health. Plus it is a great snack treat that is loved and awaited for daily.
982,"How many times have you wanted a 2nd cup of tea to taste as great as the 1st. This is what you get when you have your Twinings English Breakfast tea. It is strong, not bitter, delicious and it brings me back to my childhood having afternoon tea with my Mum and grandmother. If you haven't tried this tea, you are in for a treat."
983,"First had these at NOLA restaurant in New Orleans pre-Katrina.  As martini drinkers, we like to occasionally have different garnishes when we tire of olives.  These are just great...no fat/low carb, too!"
984,"We love our Keurig machine but found the kcups to be expensive.  This brand of coffee offers a strong, bold cup of coffee and at a lower price point that most of the others.<br /><br />We have the box of 80 delivered every month, very convenient."
985,"I really like other flavors of Stash (peach, lemongrass green and breakfast blend).  But, this has two types of cloves which I knew weren't my favorite but it also had cardomon oil which is my favorite spice.  But the cloves overpower everything else.  Numi golden chai has no cloves whatsoever so I recommend it if you want to avoid those pesky cloves.  Oh, Numi also does not have black pepper which is traditional in chai tea but is also a taste I don't like in my tea."
986,"Two of my (four) boys is gluten-free. Pizza is a favorite in our house, and I have been trying to find the perfect GF pizza crust for them. I decided to make this for all of us (my boys and myself) for pizza movie night tonight. My non-GF son and I could not tell the difference in taste from a regular pizza! This has me completely sold. Before we were using Bob's (red mill) pizza crust, but I couldn't eat it myself, so I kept searching.<br />One thing I did differently, that may help someone: I did not have any apple cider vinegar, so I used 1/2 tsp of apple juice and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. I don't know what it should have tasted like, but it tasted fine to me!<br />I also dusted my hands in GF flour before forming the dough in the pan and it made it much easier to handle (too sticky otherwise). And I also did as the above poster and par-baked the crust before adding the toppings."
987,Bought some of these in New Mexico at a co-op store and couldn't find them locally in Florida. Bought on line thru Amazon at a lower price and free shipping. The candy is wonderful and it's truly a sweet deal.
988,"I have been using this dog food for quite some time, until my dog started throwing up and basically wouldn't eat much of this dog food anymore like he used to.  I stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic.  My dog started eating again and stopped throwing up. I will not be buying this dog food anymore."
989,"Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect ""unwinding"" drink before bedtime. Not ""spicy"" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea."
990,Found a great great raspberry chocolate cake recipe at dassant.com using this cake mix.  Great chocolate cake and by far the most moist box cake I've ever had.  Tasted more like a scratch made cake.  The small chocolate chips give it an extra great chocolate flavor.  Very simple to make and great results.  Highly recommend!
991,"I'm looking forward to the cost of this stuff to come down, but I will say that the Spry gum is pretty competitively priced with all the other xylitol brands of gum out there. I've tried some others... including Epic Dental's version.  I like the taste of Spry the best... my kids really like it too, and the taste seems to last about average for gum. I'd give it a 5-star rating if it wasn't for the high price."
992,"My dog is a cute, lovable poodle/bishon mix with sensitive skin and allergies to regular dog food. She was a picky eater and had some real problems with itching and scratching herself raw--until a few years ago when we started buying Wellness. Big improvement! She loves the taste, she scratches less and her coat looks better than ever. I recommend this brand highly."
993,"I've been to Hawaii 4 times.  They have dirt there, like everywhere else.  This is some of it.  It is hysterical to sell it as food.  Enjoy, suckers."
994,"***<br /><br />this 5 pounds of citric acid was ordered 6-20-11, arrived 6-27-11. order was fulfilled by amazon and sent in a plastic bag inside a cardboard box with no additional padding to protect it in transit. fortunately the box suffered no damage so contents arrived safely. had there been damage to the box it is highly likely that the bag could have been punctured and the citric acid granules would have then spilled out. i do not recommend that you buy this sort of item from amazon-my personal experience with merchandise packaged by amazon is usually that no padding whatsoever is used or that the padding is insufficient and not properly placed between the product and outer box.<br /><br />the citric acid meets the need for which it was bought.<br /><br />***"
995,The everlasting treat ball lasted about 5 minutes for my Scottish terrier mix.  Luckily the store is willing to take a return as it cost $18.99 for something that didn't last as long as a $1 pig ear.  If your dog is at all a powerful chewer don't but this toy as it won't last.
996,i ordered these to give out for halloween instead of candy. the only problem is i didn't hide them well enough and my dear husband keeps taking them in his lunch.  perfect for on the go snacking and they are great portion control.
997,"I enjoy these wintergreen flavored lifesavers.  The flavor is refreshing without being too intense or overpowering.  I also like the texture of these lifesavers.  They are not as hard as conventional lifesavers; they have a softer texture, which is more enjoyable to chew as it crushes gently.<br /><br />I usually have one to two after lunch and my breath feels fresh for the rest of the afternoon.  A good choice of breath-fresheners!"
998,"Stash Premium Mellow Moments Herbal Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box is my new favorite relaxing tea find.  The ingredients have been listed in another review and at first glance, I was leery but Stash has created the perfect balance of flavors to create an exceptionally tasty tea; no enhancements - sweeteners, etc. are needed or desired.<br />This is one of the best teas that I have ever tasted.<br /><br />I had been drinking Choice Organic Chamomile Spearmint Tea with Bergamot, 20-Count Box (Pack of 6) until it became ridiculously overpriced but I am now happy that I was forced to try another calming tea at a much more reasonable price with a superior flavor."
999,"It's difficult to tell from the pictures and the description, but these aren't really jerky (dried strips of meat) but are smallish, moist, chewy treats made from meat and other ingredients - I suppose meat goop formed into a shape.  Think Pringle vs. a potato chip.  Anyway, our dog seems to approve - not sure it even touched the sides!  The beef, lamb and salmon varieties she tried all disappear in the blink of an eye.  A tasty treat for your dog, made in the USA, but just not the jerky I was hoping for."
1000,"10 years ago my daughter brought home Creme' Brulee' for the first time. It was perfect, beans to be ground.  Since then I have searched for ANYTHING similar. When I realized I couldn't find it, she had forgotten what one she purchased.<br /><br />This one has a strong flavor, but it tastes fake with a strong after taste. Unfortunately it is one of the better ones.  If anyone reads this and knows what ones (Carmel and Vanilla), taste great, please post here."
1001,"Out of all of the different bones and treats we've given our dog, these are one of his all time favorites!"
1002,"Delicious and fruity as described. I can only find this online so far. If this comes out in regular store, price might be little lower."
1003,"We use this mostly in the winter but also in the summer, Helps us keep healthy and tastes great! Is good for energy too and gives you all the minerals you might miss in a day of eating healthy.A lot of vit. c. to help fight off colds and flu."
1004,What can I say! I love peanuts M&M's. I love them more than the regular kinds. They're filling and tasty. I got one of those M&M gumball machines and filled it up with this. I just love them. Go M&M's!
1005,"Yo soy corredora, y he probado muchos tipos de productos, este es el que mejor resultado me ha dado."
1006,You'll want to cut the larger sections and rinse the grit off them before putting them into soup. My first experience with using dried mushrooms. The shipping and handling is a bit much for the weight.
1007,"I love these lasagna noodles, and my whole family likes them too. I've tried others that are whole wheat but these are better--maybe it's the flax seed in them--don't know, but they are great."
1008,My spoiled kitty loves this food.  I like that this is grain free and the price is better than other brands.  The food is chunky but not to chunky and it looks better than most cat foods.  I would definitely recommend this food to other cat owners.
1009,"Love that I can order this by the case.  I've been eating Country Choice for the last couple of years -- great flavor, especially when soaked over night."
1010,"We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!"
1011,"Hyper FX works great.  I am a military member in the Marines and this product was for myself, but my wife had a drink out of my 6oz. cup/one scoop of hyper fx and she loved it.  We went to the local gym nearby and I noticed her concentration in her work outs were intense!  Something I have never seen her do before.  I was shocked and amazed, she looked as if she was unleashed from chains!  Just got to say that we both love the product."
1012,"I, very highly recommend ""Treaple Leaf Tea Blood Pressure"" because it's a great product. Thanks!"
1013,"I don't use this tea for dieting but more so for a natural cleanse to keep the body free of harmful toxins.  It is very effective have used it for years!  First time users may experiece cramping but, after awhile they cease.  Great Effective Product!"
1014,This brand of Jasmine Pearls is just as good as the brands available at Teavana and Whole Foods for $4-6 per ounce.  Absolutely no difference in taste or quality.  Highly recommended.
1015,"I have been trying alot of coffee from Amazon.  I found several I like very much but this is one great cup of Coffee!  This is my new everyday coffee.  Deep, dark, rich, velvetty, cocoa, caramel but not burnt."
1016,"I purchased a package of the Spicy Kung Pao Noodle Bowl in August of 2012. The label says, ""new & improved.""<br /><br />So... for those of you who didn't like it the first time around, it may be worth another try.<br /><br />Two things to note:<br /><br />Calories per bowl = 460<br />Sodium per bowl = 1350mg (56% of daily recommended amount)<br /><br />I like these noodle bowls but do not eat them often due to the sodium content. A bit too high for one food item."
1017,"This is an excellent  product. Our small golden doodle is a very picky eater and we have tried many different chews with mixed results. Many  gave him an upset stomach. The vet suggested CET veggiedent; he has been on it for the last two years with no side effects. He gets one chew a day and his teeth are free of tartar and plaque. In addition, he doesn't feel the need to gnaw on furniture or anything else but certain toys."
1018,This snack is so tasty! I love the .5 ounce serving sizes. Perfect for the kids lunches with their sandwiches! Way better chips or Cheetos! Highly recommended!
1019,"This actually was delivered as two 5 lbs bags in the same box. As an added bonus two spoons came in the box, I am not sure what we will actually use them for. Overall this is our favorite salt, we have been getting 1 or 2 pound bags and decided to move up 10 lbs to save money."
1020,Nuts were great.  It just took over two weeks to get them and I am within the same state.  Took them over a week just to ship them them another week to go a few hundred miles.
1021,"I purchased 2 packages of this coffee and was shocked when it arrived after I read the ingredients. Tongkat Ali is touted for its many health benefits.<br /><br />But this coffee has creamer made with ""HARDENED VEGATABLE FATS (coconut, palm kernel Oil)"" How could they put this terrible oil in what is supposed to be a healthy product? Do not buy this product if you are looking for health benefits. I also purchased from the same vendor 2 packages of their ""Gold Choice Instant Tongkat Ali Ginseng Coffee"" and it does not look any healthier with a ""mixture HYDROGENATED VEGETABLE FATS"". Why couldn't they let us put our own creamer in? Why did they have to ruin this coffee with terrible HARDENED VEGATABLE FATS?<br /><br />Also, I purchased several packs at one time because of the expensive shipping charges it made sense to get more packages and pay a little extra shipping. However, now I have to pay return shipping and an 18% restocking fee!<br /><br />I will remember this next time I am buying something that is supposed to be healthy yet they do not list the complete list of ingredients. They listed the good ingredients on the website but failed to mention the BAD ones!"
1022,"This k-cup is one of my favorites along with Coffee People's Jet Fuel and Black Tiger.  If you like a strong, rich coffee, this will fit the bill."
1023,"I like the taste of Caribou coffees. I also had the Mahogany as well and like both flavors. The price on amazon beats the brick and mortar stores and free shipping saves me fuel, a win win for price and more so flavor."
1024,"It is hard to find a good gluten free cookie or cake. My son is not only allergic to gluten, but eggs and soy, and Nana's bites are free of these allergens.  These cookies are individually wrapped, so they are great for any trip."
1025,"We've tried several toys to slow down our Olympic-class speed eater.  This is by far the best -- it's easy to use, built like a tank, and most importantly, he loves it.<br /><br />-Jason"
1026,"This is a great jerkey substitute if you're vegetarian. The problem is, when it is stale, it's very hard to chew* (but still tastes good). When it is fresh, it is absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Stonewall's is my favorite brand of vegetarian jerkey. If you don't like your jerkey hot, I suggest you try mild or teriyaki. Otherwise, this is the stuff for you!<br /><br />*Edit: Someone suggested heating in microwave for about 10 seconds to soften it, and that works beautifully!"
1027,"A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom."
1028,I like this mustard as much as the more famous brand.  Pardon me - Do you have any Maille?  The plastic sqeeze bottle is a pleasure to use.
1029,"Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey. Add some sugar and milk and it's a real treat. I agree with the reviewer who found it reminiscent of hot cocoa. It does have a tiny chemical smell, or maybe that's the vanilla. I have a poor sense of smell. It's a very cozy winter tea, but I like it too much to not have it all year 'round."
1030,"Izze's All-Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a good, tart juice.  It tastes great on its own, and would probably also work well as a mixer (with a small scoop of natural vanilla ice cream?) -- the possibilities are limitless.<br /><br />I just got this juice today, and decided to give it the most extreme test I have -- drinking some right after finishing a little bit of exercise.  I was very pleasantly surprised; after drinking this juice, I felt more refreshed and even a bit more filled than other juices of this type.  (And for a dieter, this is a big-time plus.)<br /><br />Note that this isn't a sweet juice; if you're seeking that, look elsewhere.<br /><br />However, as a natural juice (unsweetened by anything save the fructose of the fruit itself), it has a fine, full-bodied taste that is worth savoring over a tall glass of crushed ice.  It's a bit similar to natural cranberry juices; if you like those, you will like this.<br /><br />Four stars, recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey"

1032,"As a fan of Dr. Pepper, I couldn't wait to try this BBQ sauce.  Unfortunately, I did get a lot of the Dr. Pepper flavor.  I used it on pork chops, and while it was a sweet sauce, I really missed the Dr. Pepper flavor it promised.  Not a bad sauce, just not a lot of Dr. Pepper!"
1033,These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee.
1034,"GOOD PRODUCT AND GREAT FLAVOR FOR MANY RECIPES.  JUST DISCOVERED AND WILL BECOME A STAPLE IN MY PANTRY.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT SERVICE, AS WELL, IT WAS PROMPT AND EFFICIENT, HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ORDER."
1035,Nice iced tea. Cool tea bags. Six boxes of twenty bags. Also good hot. Box closes well to keep tea fresh. Green tea with slight lemon hint.
1036,"These are great for when you are on the run, and you really dont have much time to cook anything.  They aren't meal substitutes, but they suffice."
1037,"We have 3 large breed dogs. Rocky, a 70lb Black and Tan coonhound, Nellie a 60lb Treeing Walker coonhound and finally the pickiest eater Buddy an 80lb Blue Heeler. Nellie and Buddy are very picky eaters. Rocky can be picky as well.<br /><br />All of my dogs will eat Gravy Train. I've fed my dogs Blue, Iams Naturals, Science Diet, Purina dog chow and numerous others trying to find one that they all will eat. Gravy Train is the only one! It seems Gravy Train really keeps their weight on them, kind of like a maintenience dog food. Once a day I mix in 1/3 of a can of the wet Gravy Train with their food and they always clean their bowls. The only other dog food they've liked as much is the Eukanuba Naturals Turkey and that is expensive and hard to find locally in my area.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend for any dogs. Though, the kibble is on the larger size, so if you have a very small dog, you might want to get a smaller kibbled dog food. Otherwise fantastic!"
1038,"So far, this is HANDS DOWN the best gluten free bread mix I've tried.  It was super easy, the instructions are right on the bag.  I substituted almond milk for the water and it's very tasty, and I used coconut oil as the oil.  Beware though, if you can't do eggs this mix isn't for you, unless you know the magic of egg substitution.  Fortunately, I can do eggs.  I left it in for an extra ten minutes after the foil was on it, and that was a good choice, it gave the bread the perfect texture.  It's slightly on the texture of a good wheat bread, but it has just the right flavor for toast or sandwiches with no weird aftertaste, and makes a large loaf.  Now the only dangers are eating all of it too fast and not having more mix to make another loaf!"
1039,"Why I thought I'd enjoy this coffee:<br /><br />1. My daily coffee is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O9GAPG"">Starbucks French Roast Whole Bean Coffee - 2.5 Pounds (40 oz.)</a>(extra bold), which some people think is bitter but I do not find bitter.<br /><br />2. I love cinnamon.<br /><br />3. I loved the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO"">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a><br /><br />4. It's winter and it seemed like it would be a good time to try something different.<br /><br />I don't like this coffee and give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />1. It is ""rank"", a term my grandmother used to describe ""too much"" cinnamon (or ""too much"" molasses) that makes it offensive. Rank is the perfect word for this.<br /><br />2. It is bitter and to be palatable I had to double my normal amount of sugar.<br /><br />Yes, I did play around with the amount of grounds to use to make the coffee (in my French press).  As I used less coffee grounds it just went watery and did not turn into ""not bitter"" and ""a non-overpowering cinnamon bad taste"".<br /><br />I also tried this iced which actually was more palatable and interesting.<br /><br />I'm disappointed in this cinnamon flavor, to say the least and am going back to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O9GAPG"">Starbucks French Roast Whole Bean Coffee - 2.5 Pounds (40 oz.)</a>."
1040,"This is Very Good Rice. I had intended to try the white rice next, but as there is no sacrifice in eating the brown (it's delicious!) there is no reason to. I say it is efficient because there is no pot to wash and no waste of rice I cooked but never get around to eating. Also no heating of the house, making it perfect for warm weather and the single rice-eater :-)"
1041,"I've been using Woeber's Horseradish Sauce for years and nothing else compares to it. Several years ago I purchased a bottle that was somewhat watery and I called the company. They couldn't have been more apologetic. Information was exchanged and a few days later I received 2 bottles of horseradish, a bottle of mustard and I think something else...don't recall.<br /><br />This past year Woeber's has disappeared from every store in the area.  I called the company again to find the nearest location to purchase the product and was told that unfortunately it was approximately 90 miles away!  The representative said she would see why the stores that I had purchased them in are no longer carrying it.  In the meantime she offered to send me two bottle at no charge.  Talk about customer service...you rarely see that anymore.<br /><br />Well, I've used the two bottles and it's still not available in my area.  I'm ordering a case from Amazon...seems to be a good price...I'd pay even more if I had to.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!"
1042,"Nevermind what was said about the lemon..Hummus is supposed to be seasoned with lemon???...ans LOTS and LOTS of Olive Oil too!  This is by far the BEST ""instant"" Hummus mix ever, and I have tried quite a few in my time.  It makes a party size (15-20 peeps) serving and leaves the bowl licked clean..everytime!  Try it you won't be disappointed..unless you don't like lemon??? (Who doesn't like lemon?)  By the way, I squeeze a BIG OL' HUNK of lemon all over mine after it has chilled :)"
1043,"LOVE TO EAT THESE AS A SNACK WHILE WATCHING TV. THE SMOKEHOUSE FLAVOR IS DELICIOUS. ADDITIONALLY, I ADD THEM TO MY BREAKFAST CEREAL WITH FRUIT. SOME MORNINGS, I ADD PEACHES. OTHER MORNINGS I ADD PEARS"
1044,"Please DO NOT buy this product or anything from HEALTHCHECK SYSTEMS! I don't know how they can call themselves by that name. I happened to read another reviewer who found mold in the water reservoir, got an exchange, and had the same thing happen. I used this as intended with the splatter shield, and ran it through multiple de-scalings by using vinegar/water, and the mold did not go away- except some gets into the food basket each time you steam! So, your baby is eating his/her food with mold in it. The company says they don't have this problem- probably because they are ignorant and don't care about me sending it back to test it, and people don't know because it is hard to see into the reservoir. I have only used this for about 4 months and am very clean. The manager hung up on me! They refused to listen to what I had to say, and stand by their 30-day return policy! Mold does not grow in 30 days! They must know their product is garbage with that kind of return policy. I can't believe they are allowed to sell products under that name that can cause babies and children to get sick! It's no wonder my baby had a temporary ""unknown"" allergy! They do not have any concern! They should not be able to sell on Amazon!"
1045,"I don't mind eating regular peanut butter because if I eat peanuts I expect to get the natural oil that comes with it.  I can get organic PB that only has sugar added and the oil is the same.  However, I love this powder! I am supplementing snacks in my diet for protein shakes and I have vanilla protein powder (it can be mixed with a variety of other flavors). But when I drink plain vanilla protein it's kinda bleh, so I add the PB2 chocolate and it's a Vanilla PB Chocolate dessert!!  I think it is great for those who are really strict with their diet and uses protein powder or smoothies and such."
1046,"This product has good flavor and is little easy on the gut, specially people highly prone to GERD(acid reflux) who love their coffee. I have tried it a few times and can say that the heart burn was less than usual."
1047,"Got these at a coop in a town I was passing through.  They were awesome!  Packaging label is marked No GMO's: stone ground corn, high oleic sunflower/and or safflower oil, organic sprouted black beans, organic sprouted flax seed, organic sprouted quinoa, pure sea salt.  Yippee!!!  A rare find!  Now . . . to get my local coop to carry them. . .  :-)"
1048,"!!! PRODUCT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARVEL!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!  WASTE OF MONEY! IF I WANTED REGULAR BUBBLE GUM TAPE FOR MY SON'S SUPERHERO THEME PARTY I WOULDVE WENT TO DOLLAR STORE OR WALMART!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053TENTW"">Marvel Heroes Crazy Rollz Gum, 24 count</a>"
1049,"The hempseeds are great! I wasn't able to buy them locally and found that buying them through Amazon not only was affordable, but excellent quality! I will continue to purchase many of the foods I need for my Raw Food diet at Amazon and it's partners."
1050,Yuck is all I can say. This drink is just too bitter and to top it off its carbonated. I tried chilling it and drinking it and it didn't do much to make it taste better. Avoid unless you like bitter drinks.
1051,"The Holistic dog food from Bench and Field is my dog's favorite. The ingredients are excellent and I can pronounce all of them! There is good meat content and grains are kept to a minimum. There are a couple of fillers in there that I could do without, but, as far as fillers go, they are less objectionable ones.<br /><br />The kibbles are small, great for small dogs and toy breeds like my Tibetan Spaniel. I learned about this food because they carry it at Trader Joe's. More reviews at my dog blog, BadDogBaxter.com."
1052,"I have been eating Power Crunch Bars for several years now and like almost every flavor. Triple chocolate is a great dessert. I keep Power Crunch bars handy so if I get hungry, I can get some protein. Love them!!"
1053,"I ordered this tree for my husband for our anniversary.  It came on time and as expected.  It is a great little tree and he loved it.  It came with complete care instructions, and it was packaged well.  I would definitely buy another bonsai from this company."
1054,"I have been gluten free for a year now, and the only things I've found hard to replace are bread, crackers, and pizza crust--until now!  I'm still searching for the perfect bread and crackers, but Mama's Pizza Crust is a great substitution for gluten pizza.  I've tried many others from homemade to frozen to restaurants, and none have come close.  The real test is my family, and they love it too, which has made pizza night so much easier now that I don't have to make two kinds of pizza.  I have found that I can get three crusts out of a package (they are thin, but not too thin), and I freeze what I don't need after the initial baking, which makes the next pizza that much easier to make--just thaw and add toppings.  FYI--I also love the Boboli sauce on this crust.  Not to sound over-zealous, but try it, and you won't be disappointed!"
1055,This product does exactly what it says it will for you. It especially helped with my anxiousness and body tension. I feel so much more relaxed now.
1056,Feels like cardboard and tastes like cardboard.  I am so disappointed.  What a waste of money!!! I have bought other brands and they are moist and thick.  Don't buy this product!
1057,"My 2 indoor cats have been on this food forever.  They do not get any canned food supplements.  However, with all the Science Diet flavors I often find that the large bag of this one is not in stock when I go to buy it in my local pet stores including the big box stores like Petco or Petsmart.  so finding it on Amazon and eligible for Prime shipping made my day."
1058,"This isn't my favorite tea ever, but it does have a unique flavor that I've never had before - really original, which is hard to come up with in a tea.  I'll buy it again, plus I'll try some of the other interesting looking flavors that Lipton has come out with recently.  Who knows, I may like one of those even more."
1059,"I'm a really harsh critic when it comes to frozen indian food as I am Indian and have tasted numerous restaurant, home cooked, and frozen indian dishes for the majority of my life.  I've been to convenience stores, all the trader joes safeways and lucky's as a college student trying to get a good affordable and tasty indian frozen dish and they've all been rubbish so far.  I decided to give this one a try and its the best indian frozen food I've had hands down.  Obviously it can't compare to tikka masala cooked from scratch, but I find it a real pain to cook indian dishes from scratch on a college schedule on a college budget.  Get this! It's worth it."
1060,"Our family (including my 5-yr-old) really likes this soup.  It is organic and in a box, so we don't have to worry about BPA in the lining of cans. Through Amazon it is totally affordable."
1061,"With the powder formula, we have to mix it with filtered water which we thought was inconvenient at night, which is why I bought this.  However it turns out the opened bottle has to be refrigerated. We don't want to feed our baby with very cold formula, so we end up having to warm it up... net net it's probably more trouble.  and it's more expensive than the powder version.  So, either buy the powder version, or buy the ready-to-feed formula in 2-oz bottles... This version doesn't make a lot of sense.  I wanted to return it but decided to bite the bullet... not very fun."
1062,"My dog gets sick eating a lot of dog treats (even Milkbones), but has always done well with all the Booda bones.  She really loves them & they're good for getting rid of the tartar on her teeth.  I highly recommend these."
1063,"Very much like the tangy yellow mustard you are used to in taste and bite.  The exception is that is has large chuncks of veggies in it.  Good, but not really what you would want to put on your dog.  Smashing with pork schnitzel!"
1064,"I had high hopes for this coffee.  I was quite disappointed.  Costa Rican coffee is, generally, my favorite. This is actually a blend of costa rican and something else.  The taste was bitter instead of the smoothness I find from coffees from this country.  I would rather drink fulgers instant coffee than this.  It's cheaper and tastes better."
1065,Got this at Costco three months ago because it was cheaper than Lipton and we go through green tea. It tastes too much like mineral water with a slight tea flavor. And it has a bad after taste. We have been drinking it off and on since we bought it and are still not half way through the package of 35. Not recommended.
1066,These are a great snack if you want something spicy and beefy.  The batch seems pretty fresh and they always taste great.
1067,I'm a gluten free vegan and it can be hard to find tasty snack bars. I recently tried these bars and they are delicious! They remind me of Thin Mint Cookies. I'll definately buy them again!
1068,"Love, love, love these chips.  They taste so good baked in the oven with cheese.  I am glad I bought the case.  I thought it would take the family a while to go through them but we have already gone through 4 bags.  When my parents babysit it is the first item they take out of the cabinets to snack on while reading.  Great product at an amazing price."
1069,"My cat gets one Whiskas Temptation treat whenever I do her nails. She's always been very compliant, but the treats have made her jello in my arms. Not so sure about the soft filling, because she swallows them whole. Ditto for tartar control. It doesn't do much for that . . . maybe would be different if my cat would chew them."
1070,"You must love chocolate to enjoy these, they are very good cookies.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Soft.<br />- Chocolatey goodness<br />- Some brownie like taste<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- The chocolate inside is not melted like in the pictures, (unless you microwave them for a few seconds) but this was to be expected<br /><br />Cons<br />- Fat<br />- Saturate fat<br />- Servings size: 2 small cookies.<br /><br />If you can eat just 2 of these and be happy, I salute you. They are addictive, but also have like 50% of the saturated fat for your whole day.<br />Eat with care"
1071,"Oh, dear God it tastes like mothballs. I really wanted to like this product and commit to it -- so I ordered a case of the creamy chocolate fudge shakes. I previously was on the Robard products, but didn't like having to go to the doctor every week so I could get the shakes (it's doctor-supervised). Robard shakes are delicious and filling, but have a lot of unhealthy ingredients and are expensive, plus not readily accessible. When I found Orgain, I thought it'd be a great alternative because it's organic. However, if you're lactose-intolerant, beware -- it contains milk. And a very strange mediciney taste. I'm stuck with a case of this stuff -- maybe if I blend it with bananas it'll be palatable. Buy a couple of the single servings, if you can find them, before committing to a large order."
1072,"I love the Honey Stinger Organic Waffles for long workouts.  So I assumed that these would be great too and bought a case of the Honey Stinger Gold Gels.  I should have read more closely because I did not realize that this is basically a shot of pure honey with some additives.  While I like honey on different things, it is way too sweet to me to take straight as an engergy gel.  They do work fine once you get them down, but the hard part for me is getting them down at all.  I even tried mixing them directly into a water bottle but that tasted like medicine.  So I will stick with the GU and Hammer Gels."
1073,"I offered my lab mix his new DRY dog food yesterday. He refused it. It was one of the Newman's Own dry dog food. No matter what I did, telling him it was a treat, holding some of it in my hand, breaking some of the in two so he might get a bit of aroma from it, nothing worked!<br /><br />Then I read one of the previous reviews that talked about a dog or dogs having the same reaction until they mixed it with the canned food.<br /><br />I had also bought some of the canned food for my large, slow-eating, finicky eater, so I decided to try adding some of it to the dry food. I opened up the can, noticed that he was standing by me all of a sudden, mixed it in with the dry food, and gave it to him.<br /><br />Next thing I knew, the bowl was empty. But then I heard him licking the bowl, the bowl being drug all over the utility room floor!<br /><br />Now, a few minutes later, he is telling me in no uncertain terms, that he wants MORE!  That is an unusual reaction for him. He doesn't get more right now because he had quite a bit.<br /><br />I'm grinning all over because this worked out so well for him. He's an older dog with somewhat fragile teeth, and I'm glad he's happy.<br /><br />EDITED the next morning to say that he ate way too much and kept me awake all night because he needed to go out. I'll have to use better judgement for him than he is obviously able to use for himself regarding portion control. I should have added only enough of the canned food to give the dry food the taste he wanted. The whole can was WAY TOO MUCH for his system when combined with the amount of dry food he ate with it. Portion Control. I will have to keep reminding him, or in this case, I will have to make those decisions for him. He would never know when to stop if I left it up to him. EDITED weeks later to say that PORTION CONTROL has worked well. He really loves these little cans, better than treats, and he loves treats!"
1074,"This is an acceptable chocolate bar, but probably not worth what they're charging for it.  It's pretty mild on the dark chocolate scale and has a slightly odd texture--definitely not melt in your mouth.  I wound up using most of my trial bar to make hot chocolate, and it served that purpose quite well--better than eating it out of hand."
1075,"These cookies are great for kids snacks and for adults. But be careful, cus a little can get out of hand! I ate half of box while snacking and watching tv one night. Plus on auto ship, they are a great bargain."
1076,"I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again."
1077,The coffee was excellent for decaf.  Not a dark coffee if that is what you are looking for.  I would purchase again.
1078,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
1079,We love these granola bars. I didn't realize that they were crunchy when i ordered them and it was such a nice surprise. They have great flavor and I feel good about my family eating them.
1080,"i have used gu,hammer and cytomax. this time i went with the 4.5 pound jug of cytomax it mixes real nice taste great and goes down so good. i have found for myself the pomegranate/berry is the best i have used and would buy it again when the time come's."
1081,"What I ordered was the Donut Collection Light Roast, but what I received was BOLD. It's good coffee, but not what I ordered."
1082,I have been buying this dog food for 6 years now. I feel good about giving my dogs a high quality lower cal food .I researched a LOT of dog foods. This one came out on top for me. And my dogs love it!
1083,My-Kaps work great with K-cups.  I have a bigger variety of options now.  I can buy pre-made K-cups or just buy a bag/can of coffee and make my own K-cups.  I can even make them any strength I want!  The brush that comes with it is a great touch in helping to clean up the cups after use.
1084,"Both of my kids go crazy for these pouches.  They would eat several in a row if we let them.  With the little one you have to be careful so that she does not squirt it all over herself and she has made a big mess in the car a few times, but by 18 months she seems pretty good at self feeding with them. Definitely recommend these if you want something your kids will love and is hopefully good for them."
1085,"Because it's nutritious, I bought a total of 96 packets to add to breakfast bags for the homeless. I figure it is a form of quick energy that can be tucked into a pocket to consume later, and no worries about peanut allergies -- It's produced in a 100% peanut-free facility. I tried it myself to make sure the flavor was right. I'd never had almond butter before and it tastes somewhat similar to peanut butter (which I love) but a bit milder, as you might expect. Printed on the package are instructions to squeeze, mix and enjoy (or something to that effect). I had no problem with the ones I tried and would buy again. Very good with 100% whole wheat and sesame seed Ak-Mak crackers, also sold by Amazon.com. It easily squirted out of the packet onto crackers once opened."
1086,"I buy these for my 75lb boxer/pit bull mix. She goes through treats very quickly most of the time. But with these Hextra chews, they keep her busy for a little while which I think satisfies her even more. I find the large size to be perfect for her as the extra large are a tad too big. They are a great product and she just loves them. My vet recommends them to maintain her dental health as well."
1087,I first tried blueberry coffee at Dunkin Donuts and I would always get it unsweetened. I was looking for something with a similar taste and this product is exactly it!! It tastes even better then the one DD'S has. Amazing!
1088,"The product itself is great, thus my 5 stars. My dogs love these and I think it's helping their dry skin, but ... WOW @ the price! I had no idea the 6-oz. size is the same package I buy at PetsMart for $4.99 - HALF the cost I paid here - and for 3 bags at that! :((((( I had run out, so I didn't have a package to check the size. I thought I'd add these to my Amazon order for convenience, and *assumed* the 6-oz. bag must be considerably larger than the ones I get at PetsMart, given that the price was TWICE - very odd for Amazon, so I never suspected the packages are the same size! People - definitely get these from PetsMart, or check PetsMart or Petco online even - this is WAY OVERPRICED! If I could have rated the price itself, it would have gotten ZERO STARS ~"
1089,"I never had much patience for Steel Cut Oats, until I read about someone using a rice cooker to make it.<br /><br />How easy could that be?  I have an old 3 cup ""fuzzy logic"" type Rice Cooker, and using ""Porridge"" mode works best.  A word of warning, do not rinse the oats, just pour in the water, set for porridge, press start, and walk away!  I am used to rinsing rice and did that with the oats, and it was really dry, not at all oatmeal.<br />If your rice cooker has a timer, you can set it up the night before too.<br /><br />Using a rice cooker makes cooking steel cut oats more convenient than cooking instant oatmeal on the stove.  It is pretty slow though, but if you are used to rice cooking times, you'll be fine.  Just don't expect it to be done in 5 minutes or less.<br /><br />And McCann's Steel Cut Oats in general?  I haven't had a chance to compare it to other brands, but I really like the tin cans.  Very strong and thick.  But I don't really like the thick foil seal, cutting it leaves a rather sharp and ragged edge.<br />Of the many cans of McCanns Steel Cut Oats, they have excellent quality control, same great taste each time.<br /><br />-Ed"
1090,"I don't have a pod coffeemaker, so I cut open the packets and put the coffee in my coffee jar when I ran out of the the French roast that was in it. I use one scoop of coffee with my Bodum French press every morning.<br /><br />So how did this coffee fare? Very well. I didn't find it too weak nor two strong. Very robust, not harsh. I don't think I'd recommend buying it if you have to cut open the pods and pour out the coffee the way I did, but you can buy the One Love Whole Bean Organic coffee from their website and grind it yourself. However, if you do have a pod brewer, then I'd recommend the pod version here without any reservation, because this is very good coffee."
1091,"This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. As far as I can tell, and from my research, no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. This stuff is only good for using at Olive Garden."
1092,"These bars are smaller then the usual health bar, taste was allright nothing special was hoping for better flavour.<br />Will not buy again."
1093,"We're very happy with the Smokehouse products we've ordered. The quality is top-notch. The Natural Chicken Breast Strips are our dog's favorite. He devours them. He gets a little gassy, sometimes, from them but overall he responds well to the treats.<br /><br />Warning: Not all Smokehouse products are made in the USA. We've found that they are clearly labeled. Generally, if they do not say USA in their main product description you can assume they come from China. We have made the mistake of ordering products made in China, and found that to be our mistake and not the manufacturer's.<br /><br />We have no affiliation with the company."
1094,"I purchased these as wedding favors, they are cheaper here than on other sites. They don't look like the picture, there are no herbs in the jar, but they are still nice. There is a gold top (not red). I put a lable and a ribbon on them and they are perfect. I have used the oregatano flavor, it is nice, but not very strong."
1095,"I thought this was a fair price for these mushrooms, but was quite disappointed.  I soaked the mushrooms, as advised and then added them to a soup.<br /><br />The next trial was in a risotto.<br />The mushrooms lack flavor in general.  The stems of these mushrooms are quite inedible; they are very tough and have to be trimmed after soaking.  I would not recommend them and wouldn't repurchase."
1096,"These are the smaller pockets, which I didn't expect, but they still work with the pills I have to give my ole' girl.  She loves them and it makes medicine time so much easier.  Truth be told, I have to keep these in the fridge to keep the cat from tearing into them."
1097,This product was just poorly thought out and a waste of money. the amount of total candy received in all 3 bags did not add up one full bag of snack sized candy. I would guess that in total there was less than $2.00 worth of candy in all 3 bags. i felt cheated.
1098,"Despite how many regions of the USA can grow pumpkins, the market for roasted in-shell pumpkin seeds is dominated by David (Conagra) due to their distribution abilities.  Although David's seeds are too salty, they are a consistent product with good flavor, dense nut meats and well regulated moisture content.  And yes,did I mention that they are too salty.  So when I came upon the high praise given to these seeds, I bought a 12 pack.  As noted, the price on these is significantly lower than Davids.<br /><br />However, I am disappointed with the product.  The first issue I noticed was the lack of grading.  Fallow seeds (flat seeds with no nut meat) and other irregular seeds are included in quantities which vary from pack to pack, but there are too many.  Additionally the nutmeats are quite inconsistent in density and moisture content.  Some nut meats have little density and just crumble during the shelling process. The shells are quite a bit thinner than the David brand, which causes them to collapse, rather than cleanly splitting, when pressured on the edges.  This transfers a lot of the salty shell into your mouth.  So although these have less salt on them, more salt is ingested in the process of eating them.<br /><br />You might be happy with these if you are looking for a cheaper product than the David brand, but I was looking for a superior product and these are not it."
1099,"Everyone's cat has its own finickiness. Our female cat, Sammy, is the pickiest eater. She has to have a rotation of different wet foods or else she just stands there and demands more... Anyway, she loved this item the first time that she ate it. However, on the second time, she was not really interested and remains uninterested. Not sure why. I am sure that the ingredients and nutrients are better, but she won't touch this food. It is a good quality product and my dogs like the similar type of food from Nature's Variety."
1100,"I was excited to find green tea with earl gray flavor.I also read my ingredients.So far so good,""bergamot flavoring"".But I also happen to read Russian,and translated the ingredient reads ""bergamot flavouring,identical to the natural one"".Why use artificial flavor when the real one is easy to come by? I try to avoid artificial colors and flavors so this one was a downer(discovered it too late).It tastes fine otherwise."
1101,We have used this seasoning on our broiled Salmon for years.  It's the best seasoning for Salmon we've ever used.  My family and friends simply rave about it eash meal.
1102,"This is the stuff from which the smoothest rum would be made!  The quality is unparalleled.  I take a spoonful/day in vinegar, or add a spoonful in protein drinks, or add to my defatted peanut flour and polenta desert.  Wholesome Sweeteners is an ORGANIC/FAIR TRADE,quality product which I have on subscription. One could not find a better molasses anywhere at any price."
1103,The Swiss hazelnut coffee has a wonderful flavor and smell when it is brewing.  I drink it almost every morning.  The Tassimo brewer is great and easy to use.  The 3 pack of the coffee is a great value.
1104,"The product is great, but I do not understand why you charged me postage this time and you have not done so in the past!"
1105,"This package of Marley coffee contains a bunch of ""pods"" designed for pod coffee makers. Look them up and boggle at the prices. I do not have one so my first try was with my French press - the purest way of making coffee. I put one pod into it and poured in a large cupful of almost boiling water. After poking it around for a while and leaving it to sit, I got a blackish coffee which tasted a bit weak.<br /><br />For my second attempt I cut open two pods and emptied the ground coffee into the press. The resulting coffee was quite strong, but as a quasi-European (English) that's the way I like it.<br /><br />What to say about the flavor? It was mild (no harshness) and fairly pleasant. The coffee in Denny's restaurants is better though."
1106,These are better than the Special K things. These actually taste like potato (because they are potato). I describe them as a mix between Munchos and O'Boises. Delicious.
1107,"I've struggled with insomnia for the last 20 years or so. It was always impossible for me to fall asleep, I just did not get sleepy at a normal time. I tried all the tricks, changed what I ate and consulted many doctors. Nothing helped. Pills would work fine for getting me asleep but made me feel so bad the next day it just wasn't worth it. I'd reached a point where I just gave up and was suffering through my life on 4 - 5 hours a sleep a night. Then one day I found Neuro. I was at a gas station on the way to spend some time at my mom's. I always struggle sleeping at other people's houses, more so than usual. The bright pretty orange bottle caught my eye, I read the label and had to give it a try. Imagine my surprise when I was able to fall asleep at a decent time! Even better I felt fine the next day. Luckily I found that amazon carries it in bulk so now I can keep stocked up for when I need it. The nice thing I found is that I don't always need a full bottle, sometimes I can just have half a bottle and it's enough to make me sleepy. This is a truly miraculous find for me, I'm so grateful."
1108,"I HAVE FED MY CAT ONLY FANCY FEAST SINCE SHE BEGAN TO EAT SOLID FOOD. IN 12 YEARS SHE HAS ONLY BEEN TO THE VET ONE TIME, WHICH WAS FOR A INFECTED SCRATCH UNDER HER EYE AS A RESULT OF A CAT FIGHT. SHE REMAINS HEALTHY AND ACTIVE. SHE GET TWO CANS A DAY, ONE IN THE MORNING AND ONE LATE EVENING. HER EYES SPARKLE AND HER COAT HAS A PLEASANT SHEEN TO IT.<br /><br />I ALSO USE ONLY CLEAN BOWLS RIGHT OUT OF THE DISHWASHER WHEN I GIVE HER FOOD AND WATER WHICH I BELIEVE CONTRIBUTES TO HER GOOD HEALTH."
1109,"PILON coffee as my first purchase on AMAZON. The experience was both easy & pleasant. The coffee is 1st rate. Strong, smoothe, not heavy and no after-taste.  Enjoyed various ways: On ice, frappe, with flavored cream or black, though I choose the latter. All real""coffee drinkers"" look for is a consistantly good  cup-of-joe. PILON nailed it. Delivery was fast and I was sent emails on its shipping progress. I was very pleased with my purchase & product. I will purchase again. Thanks AMAZON ."
1110,My dog has food allergies. She is not supposed to have any beef or chicken products.  This limits the kind of treats she can have.  She loves the sweet potato treats!
1111,I love these cookies. Once u have one u keep coming back for more. one good thing about it is that You get a lot of cookies in one packet. Kids love these too.
1112,"This cocoa powder is lighter in color than most (kind of a warm tan) but has a wonderful chocolate flavor closer to rich, smooth milk chocolate than bitter dark chocolate. If you are avoiding this because it is not dutch-process, know that the quality of this particular cocoa outweighs any such labels. It makes the best hot chocolate I've ever had, short of hot chocolate made of actual melted chocolate. It worked great in baking as well and I had no problems with leavening when using a recipe calling for dutch process. Despite the light color of the cocoa, cupcakes baked up to a very dark color just as you would get with dutch process cocoa but the flavor was superior."
1113,I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
1114,"I have this chocolate peanut butter on auto-ship in order to receive the price break. This is my little guilty pleasure product which I keep on hand. To my taste buds, this product is more flavorable, darker, and smoother than the better-known, highly advertised chocolate hazelnut product. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed...."
1115,"The discovered the Columbian-blend Starbucks Coffee about a year ago; I've tried ~6-8 different Starbucks blends, but found that the Columbian strikes a perfect balance in flavor and boldness.  Very flavorful but not overwhelmed with that bold espresso bitterness you get in something like French Roast blend."
1116,"When you have a craving for a sweet but you don't won't too much, this bar is just perfect.  It's yummy."
1117,"This exceptional tea reminds me of running in the Rocky Mountains past fields of peppermint, fragrant in the afternoon sun. We drink this tea by the bushel-load, from morning to night. The flavor is exceptional and consistent, delicious during the summer, or warming you through Winter. Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: Best accompanied by U.K. mysteries, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011B9W38"">Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases Collection</a>, and buttery biscuits, lots of 'em."
1118,THIS IS A CONVENIENT WAY TO OBTAIN A VARIETY OF SAMPLE COFFEES THAT CAN BE PASSED TO GUESTS TO MAKE CHOICES AS WELL AS DETERMINE THE COFFEE THAT IS RIGHT FOR YOU.
1119,"My local grocery store has a very awkward selection, so I supplement by buying things from amazon when needed. I buy these every month or two, and they're always wonderful! They come quickly, all of them are in there, and they're a great incentive for me to drink more water and be healthier, without ruining my diet!<br /><br />Plus, koolaid always brings back childhood memories for me of hanging out and playing outside, then having a wonderful pitcher of koolaid at a cookout! Memories and delicious - what more could you possibly want?"
1120,"I have two dogs: one is not very good at figuring out puzzle toys, even with scaffolding and attempts at teaching him, the other is like a dog genius. That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly. This is the only item I've ever purchased that she can't manipulate well. Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible. Regardless of the number of dogs in your household, this is one toy I'd pass on.<br /><br />Update: My medium chewer has now completely chewed apart the rubber pull rope with this. If I could change my original 1 star rating to a zero, I would."
1121,"It was brought to my attention by a friend who owns a local pet store that many of our three cats' problems -- weight gain, shedding, and inability to hold their food down -- were undoubtedly a result of their diet of Meow Mix. So 2 weeks ago I picked up a bag of Precise on her recommendation, and the difference in the cats is astounding.<br /><br />Their energy instantly improved. Even our old, lethargic cat started playing again. As active as they now are I am sure their weight will improve as well.  Their coats have a new shine and the shedding has been reduced drastically. As for holding down their food? I have not had to clean up a mess in 2 weeks!<br /><br />I was concerned that the price per bag for 6.6 ounces of food might stretch my budget, as it is a bit more than your average grocery store/Wal-Mart cat food, but what I have learned is that with a diet rich in vitamins and meat (not just by-products) the cats actually consume less. Factoring this in, I think the cost for a bag of Precise is very close to that of a lower quality cat food.<br /><br />I also worried the cats would not like this food, as they are extremely picky and it had reached a point that Meow Mix is all they wanted.  They love it!  I will NEVER go back to cheap grocery store cat food."
1122,"This porcelain Melitta is identical to the one I've been using for 25 years (which recently broke).  It makes a great cup of coffee, it's easy to clean, and it requires no electricity.  What could be better?"
1123,"I ordered a large quantity of these skittles because I could not find them in bulk. The tropical skittles colors fit our bridal shower theme very nicely. The bridal shower theme was ""tropical"". The skittles arrived quickly, were undamaged. we were pleased with the product. Perfect. Thank you"
1124,"The Duck seems to be the only food my dog can eat without getting sick, but it's hard to find, so when I find it I buy it for him."
1125,"This is the second DuraChew item that I'm purchasing for my Bernese Mountain Dog.  These toys are great and they last!  My dog loves to chew and destroys almost anything I give him, but this is the only toy has lasted (I purchase him a new one every 4 months) and he is still interested in playing with.  These toys are heavy so it will scratch/dent a hardwood floor if it is thrown or dropped, but that is the least of my worries.  Great product!"
1126,"I recently treated myself to a keurig single serve machine <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6"">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> and was anxious to experiment with different coffees.  I am not a fan of strong coffee so I use the travel mug size to make this blueberry coffee.  This green mountain blueberry coffee is THE best coffee ever for someone who loves the treat of a light flavored coffee and the aroma is to die for.  I am not a coffee purist and do not claim to be an expert; however I do know the difference between a good and bad cup of Joe and this gets my vote for great flavored coffee.  Please try to buy fair trade coffee - take a few minutes to read up on the subject, it is worth it!"
1127,I enjoyed the coffee and will continue ordering it in 6 month time frame.  It had a nice bold flavor and a rich aroma.
1128,"These are perfect for traveling. On the airplane when they offer you peanuts, pretzels or cookies you can take out an alternate, healthy snack. The only thing is, now I'm addicted to them, they're so good."
1129,"I am brand new into brewing loose leaf tea and this was the first cup I tried.  Delicious!!  I will never be going back to tea bags again.  I brewed it in a french press actually because I got this in the mail before my Adagio Ingenuitea arrived, and both my girlfriend and I instantly had to have a 2nd cup.  Great tea!"
1130,These are crispy wafers filled with coffee flavored chocolate cream between layers.  They are light and not filling but very tasty.  This is a longtime family favorite spanning several generations.  It's too easy to eat the whole box.  It's made in Canada and not found in the USA except through the internet.
1131,"For those of you who like flavored coffee and feel that your current chocolate flavored coffee is not chocolatey enough, BUY THIS COFFEE  The chocolate flavor is fantastic!  I just bought seven more cartons because they keep going out of stock at Bed Bath and Beyond.  This coffee is very popular!!!  If you like flavored coffee, give it a try."
1132,I like this product as it is convenient for me.  I use the  mail order because this product is hard to find in the stores in my city.  This product suits me very well except for it being hard to  find in Decafe.  I can order from Amazon at my convenience.
1133,"I ordered this and a few other items at the same time. This review is on the red, so I have to say it was great and worth the money. The Baby White was worthless and wouldn't pop right. I called them and was told I could return it for a refund of the purchase price. Problem was I paid to ship it to me, if I pay to ship it back, I may was well forget the refund, its a wash!"
1134,"Almond butter is just way too expensive for regular use.  It tastes ok compared to peanut butter, or any other nut butter.  One thing I dislike (besides price) is it is much runnier then PB, without the nice smooth texture (I'm comparing to real PB not the overprocessed stuff).  So my suggestion is those wanting the health benefits of almonds ought to opt for eating almonds in nut form rather than butter form as you'll save a ton of money."
1135,I love these Eden pasta spirals. They are a great texture (never sticky) and great quality. I hope Amazon keeps carrying them.
1136,"This isn't bad - peach but also a bit of citrus.  Was looking for a substitute for Celestial Seasonings white peach and it's not quite what I wanted.  However, a friend of mine whom I gave it to loves the product.  :)  Each to his/her own!"
1137,"I usually buy wheat grass at the local produce store, but thought that I'd try out the seed version.  It was easy to grow these grasses.  I also thought it would be fun to see what grass my kitties preferred.  They are indoor/outdoor cats, so they snack on it once in a while.  One compartment did grow some fuzzy, moldy stuff, but I just ditched that part in the trash.<br /><br />The planter itself is cute.  It's solid...a type of molded wood (made of wood particles I believe).  I'll be able to buy seeds and start a new crop once this one kicks it.  I grew it for about a week before I gave it to my cats, and it's been around for maybe 3 weeks, but is  now getting a little yellow.  I'm going to try putting it out in the sun for a day or 2."
1138,while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.
1139,This product has changed its safflower source.  I called the company today after receiving my order - which label did not match that on the company website within the past week.  They say that now the website is correct. It has only has 2g of polyunsaturated fats which is well below the 7-11g per serving that Dr Oz recommends for aid in reducing belly fat.  It is a great oil if you want it for cooking.  I am canceling my auto ship.
1140,"I guess I should have looked around more, I was expecting them in a tub. Instead they were in 3 baggies with sticky ties and it made me feel a bit uneasy.... I was thinking:  who packaged these, where were these packaged and why don't I have any product information included?<br />I don't believe the price was any better than what I could of found in a local candy store or drugstore.  I've purchased more product for less money before.  The Christmas tree shop in Wiliston, VT sells a 4 lb. tub for $5.99  but since I just moved to FL... my local knowledge of stores is limited.<br /><br />I bought these for a specific reason, I am attending a memorial service for a dear relative (who loved these) and I was planning on bringing them and putting them in dishes for those attending the service, instead because of the small size of them (I've seen larger ones) and because they have too much sugar on them, I will be keeping them at home and buying others somewhere else."
1141,I HAVE RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND AM ON A STRICT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DIET WHICH I WOULD FIND DIFFICULT WITHOUT THIS PRODUCT -- EVERYBODY NEEDS A SWEETENER!
1142,"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre."
1143,Lost my supplier for Kirkland Coffee and thought it would be the end of starting my day with a great cup of coffee.  Thanks to Amazon I found my coffee again.
1144,"I haven't tried the drink, I was looking for Izze.  I was intrigued, same concept as Izze, less cost.  However, I went directly to the website for their nutritional information: 12oz bottle of Izze is 130, the 8oz of a single serving of The Switch was in the 120 to 130 range.  Just FYI if you think you are getting the same product.  Love the concept and support their efforts."
1145,"My family loves this granola!  Whether sprinkling it on their yogurt or eating it in a bowl with milk, it has a great taste!!  The 26 ounce bags are an excellent value!"
1146,"I haven't been able to find Kudos bars, so I tried these for mid day snacks. These are very enjoyable, and taste great. I've noticed a difference due to the fiber."
1147,I was a little dissapointed. It tastes  good. It is just a little watery tasting. Land of the lakes is better. But they dont have sugar free. So for sugar free I can give a heads up on this product.
1148,"I was very surprised at how much flavor this Breakfast Blend coffee has.  The Breakfast Blend is delicious, and I will definitely be purchasing it again!  Definitely wakes me up in the morning!"
1149,I love good old fashion plain sun tea. I don't normally like flavored or instant tea but this is really really good! And I am a really tough sale when it comes to tea! Worth the price. I'll be back for more.
1150,The coffee shop next door to my old job made a great turkey sandwich with cranberry mustard and I assumed since we live in Portland that it must be this mustard (since it comes from Beaverton).  I don't think this was the one I was looking for - it had a lot of mustard seeds which I don't care for.  But it was still pretty tasty!  I shipped the rest of the bottles off as presents to family.
1151,"I love all of Annie's products, and this one is no exception. I keep them on hand for an instant lunch for visiting grandkids or even for my self. Not only does it taste better then the OTHER brand, but Annie's uses real cheese with out any of the bad stuff. This product is one of the very few ""instant"" foods that I even buy and I love it."
1152,"I am huge pretzel lover.<br />These in my opinion, are the best tasting pretzels out there.<br />They are TRULY finger licking good.  Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house."
1153,"You can purchase this directly from San-J for at least $2 less per bottle. They charge actual Published Shipping Rates based upon weight and distance. For instance it is $12.97 to ship to CA or $10.01 to ship to Alexandria, VA."
1154,"Not too strong and definitely not too weak. This is a great full bodied black tea. Nobody blends tea like the Irish and English and this barry's Tea is no exception. As Americans we access to American versions of ""Irish Breakfast tea"" or ""English Breakfast Tea"" but they all pale in comparrison to the real thing off the boat. So if you love real tea and know the different betwwen the American made ""teas"" and the best in the world then Barry's is the way to go. This Classic Blend and their other offering the Gold Blend are both amazing."
1155,"We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).<br /><br />Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross...).  These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)"
1156,"When my male dog developed recurrent anal gland infections, the vet recommended adding canned pumpkin to his meals for fiber.  Unfortunately canned pumpkin is a seasonal item in local stores.  I was very excited to find this item available via Subscribe and Save.  I have occasionally found dented cans but not frequently and not severely enough that we can't use them anyway.  Both my dogs enjoy it."
1157,The popcorn is good.  I don't like the three pouch package.  It's a pain in the A** to open the oil and the little eity-bity salt/seasoning is worse yet.
1158,"Item specifically says ""NO HYDROGENATED OILS"", but the ingredient list on the tin includes ""partially hydrogenated canola oil"". Very disappointing."
1159,"I really like the taste.<br />Awesome how it has no sugar so It doesnt keep me up at night<br /><br />*At first i didnt really like any of the zevias, but after trying them each a couple times, i just cant get enough. though this is my favorite.*<br /><br />And the price went down from 27$ to $21 which is pretty cool.<br /><br />Fantastic!"
1160,Great flavor...great price.  I usually buy Tortuga brand.  I will switch to this brand from here on out.
1161,Jack Links are always a huge hit wherever we go.  Excellent to take on the airplane and on vacation for a quick snack!
1162,"I'm not sure if there are availability issues with the manufacturer or some other mitigating factors, but the current pricing for Black Tiger is ridiculous. First, the removal of this fine coffee from the Subscribe & Save program was bad enough but the jump in cost has been an even worse follow-up. The term ""price jump"" is an understatement. This sort of increase is usually only seen in black market supply & demand situations.  Maybe it's time to go back to burr grinders and french presses."
1163,Good variety of tea. I only wanted one box but I figured the rest could be gifts for people. I like the earl greys out of it. Not a bog fan of the others but everyone has their own tatse. Quality is good. No complaints.
1164,"I decided to try Tully's brand French Roast and Medium Roast decaf coffies in Kcups from my local Staples.<br /><br />If you like bold, dark, smokey, tangy coffee like me, you will like Tully's darker roasted coffee's.<br /><br />A friend also gave me a 48 box from Amazon.com. And it is just as fresh and tasty. (all well before their printed expiry dates)<br /><br />Both were at a cost of roughly 60-70 cents a cup. Pretty reasonable. I was able to find it at the same price in a local store, but if you cannot the Amazon price is very fair!<br /><br />I usually enjoy Starbucks or Newmans-Own brand dark/bold roasts. But I will now add Tully's brand to that list."
1165,"These are great treats. I echo what other reviewers have said that they are great for training and you can't beat the fact that they are so low in calories. We previously tried Milk Bone Dry Treats and a few semi-soft options - all bigger treats, but these tasty little treats appear to be our labs favorite.<br /><br />Will only buy Zuke's in the future!"
1166,"This is a nice economical pack of Splenda, which is a great sweetener because it tastes just like sugar and since it is made from sugar, it is as close to sugar as you can get without your body metabolizing it (getting calories from it). I purchased it when it was on a Friday Sale. Just be aware that if you are going to cook with it, that it is more potent than sugar (add a lot less than the amount of sugar called for in recipes)."
1167,When i first found out about Ramune i was so excited and looked every where to get one. And when i did find it I bought it and drank it....But it was not what i expected it to taste like; It was more of a bubble gum flavor-Well thats my opinion. I though it would taste more like soda-But no. Anyways Its a good and fasinating drink. Plus when the marble goes down-Thats pretty neat. Recommended?....Yes!
1168,"This is very very good Missy. First of all, you should not be using that Kikkomann crap you<br />bought at the grocery. This is a professional grade soy sauce, naturally brewed with a very<br />smooth and savory texture that is flavorful and easy on the palate. A must for any Chinese<br />takeout, and particularly for homemade marinades. Dont even attempt to make Teriyaki marinade<br />without a good quality dark soy sauce like this.<br /><br />Lee Kum Kee is a major producer of a variety of Chinese food products for the consumer and the<br />restaurant trade. They have a fantastic website with recipes and instructional cooking videos<br />covering a range of well known dishes. 5 Stars! (link to website posted in Comments section)"
1169,"They're pretty tastey for what I remember! Nice and quick, and very easy! My husband who's in Iraq love these! He's able to come back and have something warm to eat."
1170,"I am sorry, I found the taste of these unpalatable. They were too spicy for me.  I was also upset that I got turkey instead of the beef that I ordered."
1171,"I don't like dark chocolate but I can't live without these. They were sent to me by a friend as a gift and I was not sure what to think. Now, I am buying them for myself. The tangy pomegranate covered in dark chocolate was the perfect mix of yummy!"
1172,"Best coffee i have had in years and my family loves it also. No bitterness, No acidity, Sweet and smooth!<br />Excellent coffee from La Isla Del Encanto."
1173,"I have been looking for a water like this since the last company that made this type of water went under. (can't remember the name its been so long) I absolutely abhor artificial sweetener, but water gets so old sometimes, you just want a little flavor! Well this is it folks, if you're like me and can't stand sucralose etc this should stand out for you. Still water but with a lovely 'Hint' of flavor. I tried the blackberry and it was tasty too, but the pomegranate-tangerine is AWESOME! I'm going to drink this until I can't stand it anymore."
1174,Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.
1175,"Have ordered twice before...first time they were nice and soft, second time, HARD!Hopefully by now the company is aware of this. Gonna try again and if they are hard, I will never order these again."
1176,"If you're looking for an excellent healthy snack, look no further. Buy the variety pack so you don't get sick of one type. Love them!!!!"
1177,"I unexpectedly got a box of 100. Obviously didn't check it properly. I do not regret though, as I do enjoy the taste of this tea. It's smell  is another issues. It fades fairly fast, and when you sip tea is satisfying."
1178,"I went out of my way to order this thinking I would get the old formula, the package that you see in the picture.  Nope, sent the ""Smartblend"" I was trying to avoid and there are no returns accepted on this item.  Not happy about this bait and switch....beware on this one.<br /><br />My first real issue with Amazon after many purchases....."
1179,"I've stopped trying to make my own sauce, no need when there's Pomi!  This sauce is amazing, we're more than happy to buy it by the case.  The sauce has a nice, short list of all natural ingredients."
1180,"I first tried these seeds when one of my teammates on my Sunday league Baseball team had a bag. I was hooked instantly. I ordered a pack of 12 from Amazon and brought a bunch to share with the team the following week. I have to say, at least, 15 of the 22 guys on the team consistently have these at the games now.<br /><br />These seeds are noticeably larger than other brands (i.e. David and Frito Lay). Also, these are the only Dill Pickle flavored seeds I've ever had (and I've tried 'em all, being a huge fan of Dill Pickles) that ACTUALLY taste like pickles. It's uncanny. The people at Bigs deserve a medal for this.<br /><br />Now, I'm a lifelong fan/customer. I just ordered my second case not too long ago and I anticipate having to order a 3rd in a few weeks. A++++ product!"
1181,"My dogs have been on Wellness for about four months now. I have a 10 year old lab/border collie, a 2 year old Pug/Beagle, and a 1 year old Aussie/Boxer/Beagle and they all love it! Their coats are soft and shiny as can be---I won't feed anything else!"
1182,"I drink my coffee black because I want to taste the coffee, and this is the smoothest bold coffee I've ever had."
1183,I received the product on time & it is a great sugar substitute! I have used it several times for baking & it works beautifully & tastes great!
1184,"Rapunzel is a Swiss organic foods company and this chocolate is made for Rapunzel by Maestriani, a Swiss manufacturer of chocolate. It is imported to the U.S. by Hershey. The ingredients are all legitimately organic and at least some of them are sourced through Rapunzel's own fair trade program, Hand in Hand.<br /><br />The dark chocolate has a clean flavor and is labeled 55% cocoa.

1185,This is a good strong coffee. The modified k-cup pack works well in my Keurig brewer and I suppose is less wasteful. You can't beat the price especially with subscribe and save!
1186,"This mate was much better than I had expected....Guayaki used to be really bitter, and this was good! and the company shipped very quickly! Would definitely do business again!"
1187,"[[ASIN: B0054TWRUI]]  Its a great snack that's sweet enough to satisfy my 4 pm craving for something sweet, but its low sugar. I like the combination of unusual fruit - mangosteen, something I never heard of - with a vegetable like pumpkin and a grain.  Best of all, these smoothies are low cal.  What's not to like?"
1188,"My local gourmet grocery USED to carry this product - which is how I got hooked.  My parents also love this rub - it's super consistent - skin the salmon, brush with butter and add the rub - grill and eat.  I ordered the 16 oz tub for my dad as a Christmas gift - it was probably his favorite thing I got for him.  If you've not tried it before, buy the smaller tub - but my guess is you'll be back for the 16oz!"
1189,"I really love this tea and take deliveries from Amazon every few months. Delivery is smooth and the time is adjustable, which is very convenient. With the subscriber discount, the cost of this product is as low as I have found anywhere else.<br /><br />I like the fact that this tea is caffeine free -- this allows me to drink it through my work day without feeling jittery. I also love the taste. As for the medicinal benefits -- there's no way to verify them personally."
1190,"I haven't used this particular shipment yet, but have used this product in the past, I used to purchase it regularly from a 'club' type store. When I saw this, it was several dollars more than I paid for it before, but I assumed the price had simply increased. However, while shopping yesterday at the local (non-member) big-box store, I happened across this product and found that not only does the local grocery carry it now, but ounce for ounce, it was cheaper-- whether in the large 20oz. pkg, or the smaller size packaging. I wish I'd known this, as I'd have gotten several smaller packages for less expense, and would not have to open all the product at once.<br /><br />I do like the product, it's great for seasoning vegetables, adding to salads, or as a quick addition to omelettes; I just don't like being overcharged. I'll buy it at the local grocery next time."
1191,These are GREAT.  Our dog loves them!  We (and our carpets) love them because they don't get soft and messy like many rawhide chews.  Great value and great product!
1192,"Worst blend of Green Mountain coffee I have tasted.  Not worth the cost of packaging let alone the price itself. My guests all had the same impression ""Very weak blend with no body""."
1193,I was excited to try these as I LOVE the New Grains bread products.  I found these to be heavy.  They are not bad- but they don't have the lightness and the true bread texture that the other products I have tried do...
1194,"I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go-mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.<br /><br />This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia-based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine-free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right."
1195,This is a great tasty drink that I found while visiting a spa over the summer.<br />Good and healthy and just a tad sweet--naturally!!<br />Enjoy.
1196,"I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, ""They are the best part of my day!""  We think so too!  ~ CJ"
1197,"These taste terrible. I threw away the bowl I cooked after one bite, and I will prepare the noodles from the other bowls with any sauce other than the sauce they came with."
1198,"The worst popcorn in the world!  At one time this might have started out as popcorn but the product I received was as stale as if it were extracted from King Tuts tomb.  What was supposed to be cheddar cheese was some alien goo that seemed to be spray painted on creating a coating for this stale mushy 'stuff' that was billed as Double Cheddar Gourmet popcorn.  I did contact Cornzapoppin and they have ignored my concern.  Garrett's of Chicago is a far better product that arrives with crunch, and at a better price."
1199,"These are the best tasting almonds. I buy them in bulk to share at work. Any time someone finds cheaper almonds, they always come back to these because they can't be beat."
1200,"I have searched for a great decaf chai and have finally found it.  It is excellent made with either water or milk.  I usually drink the water version in the mornings and the milk in the evenings as a dessert it is so wonderful!  If you are hesitant, give it a try via the smaller individual package."
1201,"I had a balance left on my gift card and saw that the jerky was on sale.  So I bought a couple of cases.  This stuff was extra salty, too salty.  Something must have been wrong with the batch.  You could actually see the salt on the jerky.  Had to throw it away."
1202,There where great I will be buying this again.<br />Everyone should buy this it will get you up in the morning.
1203,"There was actually more usable chunk tuna in one 3 oz. Tin of Genova than a 6oz Tin of Star Kist tuna, which was shredded and shrank down to about 1/3rd weight after draining the water. With the 6oz. can of ""XXX"" I only had enough to make ½ sandwich but the mayo and onions tasted good.<br />I made a tuna salad sandwich with Genova, green onions and celery with mayo on an onion bun. You will not need to add salt. I just drained the oil from the can and mixed it with the ingredients.<br />I intend to use this with a green salad mix or even pasta.<br /><br />Although I do like salt, next time I may try rinsing the tuna in a colander but not pressing it. With some of the shredded stuff you may just end up with a spoon-full.<br />For quick meals, I used to like Hot-Dogs but not any more. The taste of this yellow-fin tuna is quite good, actually much better than I had expected. Some of the tuna you get from the local grocery store may look like cat food when you open it up. This definitely does not.<br />I will buy it again because you can't beat the Amazon price with Free Shipping."
1204,Since I am not the one who eats this I can't vouch for the taste......however the dog seems to love it. One thing we as dog owners like about this food is that it cut down the gas our schnauzer had. We switched from another food which really made the dog gassy. That one simple thing alone makes this food awesome!!!!  Amazon has this for about 10 bucks lower than pet smart so it makes it a good deal.
1205,"This is the best water!! Chocolate mint satisfies your chocolate craving without the guilt!! NO Sweetener No Artificial Flavors- Just Mint, Chocolate and water! YUMMY!"
1206,This was very much like a non-GF dough.  Rolled out nice and cut out nice cookies with a variety of cookie cutters.  They tasted great too.  My non-GF family members liked them just as well as my GF family members.  They did need to cook a bit longer than the directions said.
1207,Love Starbucks coffee in the K-cups.  It is cheaper to buy it here then in stores.  It came right away and the coffee is great.
1208,"Sooooo disappointing. The coffee smells great but what emerges from the coffeemaker is what my mother used to refer to as ""dishwater."" In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend."
1209,"Excellent Italian canned tomatoes.  I have used 6 of 12 cans already and every can has been perfect.  Big tomatoes, peeled very well. The liquid is a thick sauce, not a watery juice.  Excellent for marinara.  You can't go wrong.  Plus save all the hauling cans from the store.  I am very satified and will order another box when I use these up...Plus free shipping...how can you go wrong?<br />Donna Beverin"
1210,"These come out moist and delicious. They are versatile, and you can easily add shredded carrots or raisins, etc for variety, or top with flax seed or wheat germ. They aren't overly sweet, just right. The mix makes preparing them a breeze, and I love that the box makes only a half dozen - just the right amount for me and my daughter to eat in a day or two since my husband is scared of bran! The ingredients are all natural (although I wish they were organic too!). Try using coconut oil for your vegi oil when you make them, you will be pleased with the hint of extra sweetness."
1211,"THIS IS VERY HOT AT FIRST, BUT, THEN IT CALMS DOWN.  DAVE'S INSANITY STAYS HOT LONGER. BUT MY HUSBAND IS HAPPY WITH THE BOTH OF THEM."
1212,"Excellent. Rich, dark and earthy. I was disappointed by the usual K-cups, which gave me thin, bland :meh: coffee, but saw that Emeril's coffee got good reviews here, and by God, they're right. I still feel guilty about the waste involved with this system, but if you;re going to use Keurig coffeemakers for their convenience, and want coffee deserving of the name rather than weak bitter swill, look no further."
1213,"I love to have a cup of coffee at night but I'm always leery of how caffeine might affect me.  Tully's Decaf House Blend is perfect!!  During the day I drink Newman's Own Organic Special Blend and in the evening I have a cup of Tully's.  While they don't taste exactly alike (Tully's is a little weaker, I'd say) it's still a great alternative.  It's so hard to find a good decaf and I'm thrilled that I finally found one!!  It's fairly strong and bold but not skunky or overpowering in it's flavor.  I highly recommend it!!"
1214,"My baby loves this stuff. It is a great texture and actually reasonably tasty. I like that he gets some protein, and that the flavor combination isn't as boring as some."
1215,it is hard to believe the instant coffee can have the same taste as brewed one.
1216,"Our cats absolutely love these treats and they are rather picky eaters. We've bought countless bags of cat treats only to toss most of them shortly after opening because our cats turn up their noses. I usually buy them locally but when our store ran out of stock and I couldn't find them anywhere else, I had to venture online. Kitty tested, kitty approved."
1217,"I got this for my sisters because they have like 25 cats and the description promised it could repel cats.  Which really sounded like a good idea to put around areas of the yard and such where they didn't want cats or other critters to get around.  It seems to work well enough, though I'm not around that often to check every minute of the day.  That is all."
1218,"I was buying this as a replacement for our coffee at the fire house. Little did I know my math skills were a bit off. My goal was to get a better coffee for the crews at a equal or better price. I miscalculated and realized that I was over charging for the coffee, so I decided that I'd just keep it and drink the mistake. Wow it isn't a flavor mistake. My wife and I love the coffee and it's flavor. It has a bold flavor with a smooth finish. No bitterness or bite at the end. I just finished the first of 4 bags I have. It has lasted a long time and I look forward to each and every cup."
1219,"I got these because Amazon no longer carried Deruyter sprinkles when I went to buy them. I couldn't find the Deruyter sprinkles anywhere, so I gave these a shot. Not quite as good on my toast in the morning or on ice Cream, but a close second and about equal in price.<br /><br />This:<br />Deruyter Chocoadehagel Puur (Dark Chocolate Sprinkles), 14-Ounces Boxes (Pack of 3)<br />by Deruyter<br />List Price:  $22.47<br />Price:  $17.31 ($0.41 / oz) Eligible for free shipping with Amazon Prime.<br />You Save:  $5.16 (23%)<br /><br />Now back - would be my regular purchase.<br /><br />That's what happens when you work in northwest Europe - you get hooked on this stuff."
1220,Family members are allergic...very allergic to MSG.  This IS MSG free....plus it is great crab.  Makes fabulous dip or incredible crab cakes.  The save and ship is a great option.And it really is natural.  THat makes it a keeper in our household.
1221,"I received my case of Izze Grapefruit Sparkling Juice on a Tuesday, and it was gone by Friday.  My wife and I sampled one can together, and immediately put the whole case in the fridge, pushing aside other juice beverages to make room.  For the next two and a half days, my wife and I eye-balled each other every time we went to the fridge, keeping tabs on how many cans were left.  And on Saturday, the day after the last can was gone, we felt like Izze addicts, jonesing for another can.  Just one more...<br /><br />If you are a Fresca fan, you will more than likely love this beverage.  It has a snappy, zingy body, light and refreshing, perfect with ice.  This would make an outstanding summer drink in a tall glass with ice, out on the deck, reading a book in the sun.  I dare say it wouldn't be a bad mixer, either, if you wanted to spike it  ;^)<br /><br />The nutritional content of the drink is what you make of it.  With 70% juice and 30% sparkling water, it's 8.4 ounces are going to have some calories (90 in a can).  It's also going to have vitamin c and niacin.  I've noticed some reviewers say that you'd be better off taking a multivitamin, but if you're drinking it strictly to get vitamins, I think I'd have to look at you with my head tilted slightly to one side and make a Scooby-Doo noise at you.  :^)  No one should get all of their daily recommended vitamins from a drink like this; what Izze is going to do for you is be a tasty, refreshing drink that's a much, much better option for a health-conscious person than a diet soda or most other drinks that you enjoy as a treat.<br /><br />If you're ever in a convenience store and notice an Izze drink in the cooler door, pick one up and try it.  Don't buy a case because it might not be your thing... but do try it.  I loved the Grapefruit version, and I will certainly try the other flavors as well."
1222,"This is a good coffee from Tully's, but it is not as bright as Full City.  Seems to be a little strong without the flavor you hope from a stronger coffee."
1223,"Expires in Dec 2011 and I did not get half of what the picture shows.  I got mostly Timothy's (which are not my favorite) and the ones I was excited to try were missing.  Don't think I would order from here again, better luck with the Keurig website."
1224,"If you like bergamot flavor - this tea is for you. I have tried many brands, some expensive ones. This is one of the best teas, for me and all my family. It has very strong begramot flavor which makes tea so good. There are quite big tea leaves. Earl Gray tea lovers - please try this one, you won't be disappointed. Price is OK, about $9 per 8.8 oz (250 grams) pack in local stores here in North-East or Tri-State area."
1225,"These are excellent chips, except Amazon couldn't get the order straight and twice sent me cases of Red Hot Blues. Great. What does a single person do with 2 cases of already flavored chips? Yep, give them away. I liked the Red Hots, but wanted these with no seasoning (I make my own salsas) for every day and Amazon just couldn't pull it off. The case was even clearly labelled.  Go figure. Amazon did refund my money fully."
1226,This coconut drink is not bad compared to other drinks. This drink tastes best when really cold. No straw. It is not like juice boxes where you puncture the straw through the foil. Although I would have preferred that it came that way. It would prevent spills for the kids. But then again this is not marketed for kids. It is really easy to open. Pull a foil and you are ready to sip. The mouth is not that big nor to small. I would recommend this to someone who enjoys coconuts.
1227,"My cat will eat it, and I'll use it in a pinch when I am out of Wellness canned cat food.  I wish it came in a fish only flavor.  Also I all the fruits and vegetables my cat gets when eating the Wellness brand."
1228,I feel in love with Da Vinci Sugar Free Vanilla Syrup with Splenda. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
1229,this is a good tasting mixture once you get used to the longer cooking time it works out great
1230,"I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor."
1231,"I am a Big fan of coconut Oil. This is great tasting Coconut Oil. Does not have a strong flavor of coconut, it is very light. I use it in everything. My husband doesn't like coconut and he likes this."
1232,"Not only is this a high quality food, it is USA made.The distribution is at Ohio pet foods, which is an EU certified plant. This means all ingredients are inspected and guaranteed FDA approved. It has complex carbs without a ""window dressing"" on their ingredient panel. What I mean is that it doesn't add any unnecessary ingredients that when cooked, loses the nutritional value, ie:berries, vegetables, etc. This company caters to the health of your pet. NO artificial preservatives or steroids. This formula has very high omega 6 and 3 fatty acids, which is something dogs cannot produce themselves. I put our yorkie on this in the winter when she needed a little extra ""umph"". She normally eats the life advantage, chicken formula. Her coat started to get dull though when the cold weather started to hit. Although the fish has a pungent smell, she loves it! She took to this one easier than she did with the life advantage, I guess cuz it does smell so strong. The testimonials on their site has some before and after pics of dogs with skin conditions who went on this formula. I couldnt believe the differenc. Check it out! [...]<br />I highly recommend this!"
1233,This sample pack had a wide variety of flavors included.  It is like a K-Cup warehouse exploded and they swept the mess into a box.  It included many varieties I would have never tried.  I am sure I will find a new favorite flavor here.
1234,My little dog loved these. Were first sent to me by a friend in another state. I couldn't find them in my city so ordered them over line. Very happy with them. Will order again.
1235,"I love Starbucks but I don't like paying the price for espresso from Starbucks. When I was looking around on Amazon and found these beans were brewed by Starbucks and made by Kirkland, me being a Cosco lover and a Starbucks lover I was sold! Verrry glad I decided to go with these beans! They taste like high quality espresso beans, I get compliments all the time when I make friends and family lattes. You can not go wrong! purchase these beans!"
1236,"My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good. They have three calories per treat. About pea-sized.<br /><br />I used them for training and when they go to their areas when I head out to work in the morning.<br /><br />There's really not much more to be said. I did set up the amazon subscription on a two-month basis and may bump that up to monthly eventually. I will see.<br /><br />I can only recommend these because the price and value are excellent and they are great if you have does. Light, small, portable."
1237,This is THE WORST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. These seeds were DISGUSTING and unclean. If understand they're raw... but my bag had WORMS in them. WORMS.
1238,"As a kid, I scarfed bags of the Calbee Sweet Potato chips that my mom would pick up at the local Asian market. As my tastes refined in adulthood, I was less inclined to buy bags of those chips that resembled styrofoam even if I still craved their sugary sweet and salty flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips Sweet Potato chips are the adult version of the snack I grew up with. There's a delicious sweet and salty mix in every bite.  The chip is light and airy, without resembling a foamy rice cake and the deep orange hue is the color of a perfectly roasted sweet potato.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of sweet potato chips from Amazon in the past (Both the ""Terra"" & ""Food Should Taste Good"" chips) which have all been good, but they didn't play up the sweet and salty combo quite as much as I'd like. The Terra chips are more like simple sliced sweet potatoes, oven dried and turned into chips; the Food Should Taste Good chips are like yummy, sweet potato flavored, salty tortilla chips; and these Pop Chips sweet potato chips are, well... sweet potato pop chips.  If you've never had a pop chip before, the weight of an individual chip probably most resembles Baked Lays - but with a puckered, air-puffed texture.<br /><br />There are 100 calories per bag.  24 bags come nicely packed in a box that you can tear open for a neat display in your pantry.  I've purchased bagged chips online a number of times and have received packages where the chips were thrown into a box which was thrown into an Amazon box for shipping so by the time they got to me, all the chips were broken.  Not so with this packaging, they're tightly packed so the the bags don't shift around much in shipping and the few bags we've already eaten have had no more broken chips than what we'd get from picking up a bag in the store.<br /><br />Happy snacking!"
1239,Leaves me full for several hours. We love this stuff. We don't love the sugar in it. Wish they'd sweeten it with stevia.
1240,"I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is ""insipid"" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan."
1241,"This is my second purchase of these almonds, and this time around I am very disappointed. They taste old & stale, and are a bit chewy - not a good sign for a supposedly roasted almond. I won't be buying them again."
1242,"This stuff is really yummy.  It took me a day or two to get used to it, but now I prefer it over the other fudge sauce that I was using. I generally don't keep chocolates in the house, so when the chocolate cravings hit, I head to the jar with my spoon!  It is a very rich flavor.  On the bitter side, which I really like.  I like it best when it is cold."
1243,"I am a vegetarian, and my boyfriend is not. I really like this product, and love it mixed in with scrambled eggs for breakfast, or in veggie Chili. Sometimes I eat it right out of the can if I am feling particularly lazy. It doesn't stick very well to itself, so it doesn't make very good burgers IME, even with a ingredients added to help it stick. Back to my boyfriend, this product gave him MAD GAS, and intestinal upset. He is afraid to eat it and asks me if I used ""the canned burger stuff"" before trying anything I cook. It digests just fine for me."
1244,"We LOVED this product until shipments starting arriving in June--in Texas.  The taste is terrible!  No ginger taste left, not happy with the product at all any more.  Sad...loved it back in the winter and spring.  Guess it can't survive the heat in travel."
1245,I am always on the lookout for chew toys for my dogs. They are both big chewers. Most toys last about two days. This one has lasted all week! I am impressed.
1246,"I started using the Baby Brezza a couple of months ago and I have been able to make fresh, homemade, tasty baby food for my 7.5 month old daughter with such ease it has been a delight!  I wish this had been around when I had my first daughter as I attempted to make her baby food, but gave up after a couple of weeks.  The Baby Brezza has made it possible as a working mom of two young girls to make my little one's meals that are easy to make and don't require constant monitoring.  You just chop up the veggies, select the steam time, press steam & blend, and walk away.  A little while later, the food is ready and there's only a few parts to clean up.  I can make her food 2-3 times a week with different ingredients and blend different veggie/fruit combinations.  I've tested sweet potato, apples, pears, peas, carrots, avocado (just blending), mango, peaches & plums and various different combinations. I envision this will be useful for many months and afterwards steam veggies for the entire family.  It will definitely more than pay for itself with the money saved!  Of course, I could make it with other kitchen equipment, but the Baby Brezza saves so much time and makes the whole process much easier and I'm much more likely to continue to make her food for as long as possible."
1247,Cost effective and to see all three of our picky kitties enjoy their food is quite an accomplishment in this house.  I'd order this flavor and brand at this cost anytime.
1248,"This is an excellent gluten free alternative to oatmeal.  The taste is really not like any other hot cereal, the buckwheat isn't dominant but compliments the corn.  Sort of like a variant of grits, but I like it with maple syrup, cinnamon and apple chunks."
1249,Use this and some sweetened condensed milk (with hot water) and you have yourself the tastiest and healthiest backpacking food
1250,"These are amazing. The package makes my toddler really excited to eat them, they taste great, are portable. . .what more could you ask for in a snack? My daughter likes them so much I can use them as a reward to bribe her to do just about anything. I need more!"
1251,"I ordered these and recieved Quaker 5-Minutes Quick Grits instead of Old Fashioned.  No problem returning them (other than the hassle), but not what I was expecting"
1252,"My kids eat LOTS of peanut butter! After finding out how much hydrogenized fat is ADDED to regular peanut butter, I quickly switched to Smuckers. We eat it so fast, that we only need to stir it after the jar is opened for the first time (I buy 2 jars a week). My whole family loves the taste of it, and it makes the BEST peanut butter cookies EVER!!!!!!!!"
1253,This non-extract sauce has a very pleasant fruity flavor and is hot enough to make my nose run. Will buy another bottle when mine runs out and definitely recommended.
1254,"I am wary of celebrity chef endorsements for coffee, but I was wrong here...this coffee is BOLD, DARK and beautiful.....one of the best K-cup's of coffee I have tasted so far. Excellent balance with cream, this along with Green Mountain dark magic are my two favorite K-cups!"
1255,My husband is allergic to wheat; this is a great substitute for bread crumbs.  Tastes great.
1256,"These are great dorm food. Requires a pan and some butter, but it's a great alternative to Easy-mac (ugh)."
1257,"We luved original Zico, but now its taste totally different.<br />When introduced it was pure coconut water which was just pasteurized.  Now it says its from concentrate.<br /><br />Taste little different now!"
1258,Tomatoes are growing as stated.  Everyting is fine so far.  Product is a bit pricey.  That is the only negative I can see.
1259,"I have tried many of the varieties offered and really like all of them.  They are nice to have on hand for when you really don't feel like having a large meal, yet you still want something warm and easy to make.  My child loves them and is pleased when a case arrives knowing that they will be available for dinner in a moment's notice.  Great cheese flavor and no cardboard taste at all.  Definitely a winner!"
1260,"For the price, this is totally worth it. All the flavors are great except for the hazelnut(in my opinion). Peppermint is my number one favorite. It may seem odd that there is a raspberry flavor however torani doesn't just make coffee syrups. The fruity flavors can be used for smoothies or italian sodas!"
1261,"Although it says ""Wing Rub"" don't be confused, I put this on everything! Everything!! One of the best on the market!! I have ordered many for family and friends (the three pack) and they all love it! Can't get enough of Kramers! You have to try it for yourself. The website has amazing recipes as well. It's the gift that keeps on giving, until you have to order more!"
1262,Great beans.  Nothing like homemade real vanilla.  Split them and let them soak in vodka for 5 to 6 months and you will never buy store bought vanilla again.
1263,We love this coffee. It is all we buy now. BUT we can get it at Walmart in these 11oz bags for $4.78. The Amazon price is about double that.
1264,Product is excellent and customer service is very good. I have recommended this product to several other people.
1265,"FYI - I just visited this site and the price of the whiskey is actually $42.99, not the price it says here..."
1266,"We eat lentils about once a week as they are one of the more nutritious foods in existence. I have fewer 'rejects' than with other brands and they cook up quickly nice and tender without turning to mush. I sautee my veggies first: all small dice: a couple of serranos (since we eat spicy--this is optional), a large onion, a couple of carrots, lots of celery, a whole garlic fist, tomatoes (I often just use a can of organic diced tomatoes, sometimes fire-roasted), sometimes leeks (although i put those in later or they will disappear) with whole cumin seed, oregano, turmeric and curry powder (I use the Simply Organic brand which I like the best after much exploration). Seasonings can vary. Coarse grind black pepper. A little trocomare or herbamare depending if I make my own stock, use prepackaged or just water. Sometimes add leftover chicken or lamb. After the veggies are quite sauteed add the liquid and lentils and bring to slow simmer. Do not let them boil hard but they need to slow simmer to cook. Hmmmm. I may need to go make some now. Especially delicious the second and third days. I add fresh parsley just as serving or sometimes serve over fresh spinach to just slightly cook it. Pita or cornbread goes well. My family enjoys different types of cheese as topping.<br /><br />I am on my third order of these and have yet to find a stone.<br /><br />Update: When I really did just go make these I realized that those unused to using bulk products may not know you need to sort through any product like this. I just pour them into a container and then have another container to slowly pour them into as I sort through them. My new shipment are the BEST lentils I have EVER used in about fifty years anywhere. Only had about ten discards (any lentil that I would not want to eat and I am very picky--broken, dirty, etc.)<br /><br />Also, I just read the instructions on the package which do not make clear that you need to sort through and then rinse the lentils before using. Do not salt any bean-type product until the end or they will be tough.<br /><br />I don't use recipes so I realize that my seasoning amounts are unclear. The only thing you need to add right away to the saute is if you use cumin seed. You can always add more of everything else later. If you want it spicier you can also add something like cayenne, even after serving. I forgot to mention that I sautee all my veggies in a bit of coconut oil for health reasons (it is the only stable oil). You do not taste this later and I finish it at the end of cooking with some good olive oil.<br /><br />When I mentioned the fist of garlic: this must be minced. I use a meat cleaver to smash the cloves to peal more easily and then fine dice. Wait ten more minutes to allow the allicin to develop DONT WAIT LONGER. Allicin is the anticarcinogenic property of garlic and must be exposed to oxygen to develop, but it will start to diminish after about fourteen minutes.<br /><br />OK--there is my novel on cooking lentils! Hope this is useful to someone."
1267,"I usually don't write reviews b'cos my feelings, whether good or bad, have never been strong enough to  write a review. until now that is. this must be the worst cereal ever made. they look like cheerios but taste nothing like cheerios. I added liberal doses of honey to try and get through one bowl and couldn't. The cereal also has a funky smell (kind of like wet cardboard). amazon does not accept returns on this item so beware about buying pack of 6. I am sticking with chex (gluten-free) for now."
1268,"I was buying Lavazza Caffe Espresso at local vons for 5.99. Now it's 7.99 so I checked amazon. still more than 5.99 so I bought this, cheapest Lavazza for 18.98 with subscription.<br /><br />according to their website, Caffe Espresso is medium, this is dark roast and this has some sweetness.<br /><br />when i opened the package, soon i noticed this has a stronger aroma, a bitter kind. unlike starbucks italian dark roast, it's still brown.<br /><br />i used bialetti moka machine. usually make it latte. i think this is bitterer than Caffe Espresso and I feel some bitterness remains on my tongue. maybe this is more like natural Espresso taste but I prefer Caffe Espresso. and i have one opened pack and three unopened packs left..."
1269,"Agave is wonderful with peanut butter for kids' sandwiches, on toast or pancakes, in tea, as a substitute for sugar, honey, and syrup.  Everyone in our family enjoys its flavor."
1270,"These are some of my families' favorite candies. We were so happy to find them available on Amazon.  They came in quickly and were exactly what we wanted. They made great stocking stuffers, but we will be purchasing more just to snack on."
1271,Not a fan of this coffee. Very bitter and rough flavor. Also our machine started acting up after using these k cups which are not the standard type.
1272,"This kept my dog's attention for a couple minutes the first few times we used it, but now she has no interest.  I think my 2 year old enjoyed it more than my dog did.  It seems to slide around too easy and our dog has a tough time getting the yellow ""cups"" out.  She's not overly food driven, so that may be part of the problem.  Guess we'll try something else."
1273,"I have been buying these 4 packs from my local grocery store for $6-$10 each week.  When I saw a 24-bottle case available on Amazon for only $28 w/ free shipping, it was a no brainer!<br /><br />They taste good and are fresh! Would recommend to a friend! I am subscribed for a regular delivery now!"
1274,This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
1275,"These treats are much smaller than I thought they would be, and they only lasted a few seconds with my dogs. For the price, I could have bought a whole bag of treats and the dogs would have gotten the same enjoyment. I gave them two stars only because my dogs did seem to like the taste. But then, they're not exactly picky."
1276,"I purchased 3 containers of this cereal all having expiration dates in 2012.  The first container I opened seemed fine (at least I hope it is! I fed it to my 5 month old!) The cereal color was a pale whitish-tan and there was relatively no odor to it.  Baby likes it so I am happy.  The second container I opened (again, same packaging, and good expiration date) had a totally different color - this time it was brownish-green. However, the worst part was the rancid smell.  It smells like rancid oil.  I opened the third container - same brownish-green color and and same rancid smell.  Very unhappy with this product.  I have contacted the company, but have had no reply yet.  I would not recommend feeding this to your baby."
1277,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2DQ8M"">Bar Harbor All Natural Lobster Bisque, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Thanks to all who reviewed this product! We appreciate the conversation and realize there can be quite a variety of opinions on any food item based on the vast majority of palates and individuals' past experiences with foods.<br /><br />As a Downeast Maine company that has been producing Lobster Bisque from a local recipe since 1917, it is believed that the recipe, handed down from previous generations, was the most accurate rendition of this regional soup. This is not to say that it is the only recipe or the most popular in this genre of soup, as bisque originated in France and was handed down through immigrants who settled in the Canadian maritimes and then migrated to coastal Maine.<br /><br />The original recipe included the tomalley, or liver, of the lobster and provided a truly robust seafood flavor and a deep orange tone to the finished product. With concerns over mercury in seafood, the recipe has been modified in recent years and a larger quantity of minced lobster has replaced the tomalley. This along with a bit of paprika gives the soup its distinctively strong color. The recipe does not include any tomato products. As to the cream content, milk is an ingredient to create the true bisque texture, however, we intentionally leave the soup in a semi-condensed state to allow the customer to prepare the product to their liking. By adding a bit more milk or cream and a dash of sherry at the end of gently heating the bisque, true restaurant-quality lobster bisque can be achieved.<br /><br />This is one of our most popular soups and at over 20 annual international trade shows it receives rave reviews. Thought we realize we cannot please every palate, we believe the majority of our lobster bisque connoisseurs provide us the confirmation that we are making a high quality, great-tasting Lobster Bique.<br /><br />Bar Harbor Foods is now on Facebook, so please ""Like"" us if you enjoy our products and we appreciate hearing from all of our customers!<br /><br />~ Bar Harbor Foods"
1278,"Not only did I get an excellent price on the Pill Pockets but the turnaround time, using standard shipping, was 3 days from the time I placed my order until it was delivered.  I understand why they have such a high Feedback Rating and it is well deserved."
1279,"Vegeta is a great seasoning for almost any thing you can cook.  It brings out wonderful flavors in the dish, especially things like chili, spaghetti, casseroles and seasoning for any meat."
1280,"This stuff is great!!! No powder to worry about, and the flavor is just like BREWED iced tea, without all the hassle...I carry a few in my purse at all times; just in case.  I've already gotten a few friends hooked on this product, the flavor and convenience are great, I especially like that there is no ""powder"" taste like with some other products of this nature..."
1281,great candy at a great price you get 1.5 pounds of fruit flavored sugar ( good stuff ) i will order these again it came with a great price and amazing delivery to your door :)
1282,This has become my favorite everyday tea. It's has a great flavor and takes a lot of overbrewing before you have to worry about it becoming bitter. It's also quite affordable for a quality tea.
1283,We received Stash Premium Chai Spice Black Tea Tes Bag 100 Count box on time. All tea bags are in a big box . The product is good as expected.
1284,"I prefer glass jars for my kids because I'm not a huge fans of them eating from plastic so much. But I understand that there are times that you need a meal on the go with minimal mess. This seems perfect for that situation. And I feel that the company is doing as much as they can to make it a safe product with these pouch things being bpa free and all.<br /><br />My only complaint is that one pouch leaked in shipping. It didn't leak too much, but that makes me hesitent to order more off amazon. I know that amazon would replace any that leak, but I don't like hassel in ordering online.<br /><br />I feel the review is for the product, and this stuff is great! I tasted it and it tastes very close to applesause but not as sweet. I do like the container design and my youngun is able to eat it by herself with just a bit of me helping to squeeze.<br /><br />It may sound probably dumb to give a great review with all the qualifiers (bad plastic, leaking product), but we really do like them. I would definately suggest them."
1285,"My cat Basil is a huge catnip addict, he will find the package, and try to open it in the middle of the night if I don't place it out of sight.  I was excited when I saw this int he store thinking he would love it, but quite the contrary, he hated it.  It must not of smell like the real stuff to him.  He was totally turned off.  If you have a cat who is a fiend like mine, is, nothing make up for the real thing!!!"
1286,"BBQ = very tasty.<br /><br />Original = Not that tasty.<br /><br />Cheddar is Okay and the sweet potato, if you can find it, is light on flavor but good none the less.<br /><br />Go with BBQ. You wont regret it. Probably."
1287,"As a confirmed Hamburger Helper junkie, I was very curious to see if Velveeta had the goods to dethrone ""The Helping Hand"" as my comfort food of choice. First off, I'll say this: The ULTIMATE CHEESEBURGER SKILLETS DINNER does, indeed, taste remarkably like a real cheeseburger. Going beyond just offering cheese-covered noodles and ground beef, there are hints of ketchup and mustard and onions, among other tantalizing tastes. My Wife, who is not a big fan of Hamburger Helper, stopped after a few bites- The mustard taste was too much for her. My eight year-old Daughter, not a huge fan of meat of any kind, loved it. For my part, I ate my first helping with gusto, but by the time seconds rolled around, the spice mixture was getting to be overpowering and a bit sickening. I scrapped the noodles and ate the rest of the ground beef. It wasn't bad, but the spice mix wasn't something that made me want to keep eating it. I'll happily try other Velveeta Hamburger Helper knock-offs, but this one didn't quite hit the spot the way I'd hoped."
1288,"the product -- roland herring fillets in tomato sauce -- was exactly what i hoped and expected it to be ... making the purchase was easy and it was delivered sooner than anticipated, which made the whole transaction an excellent experience"
1289,"I am always looking for something to send to my sons (one is in college the other in the military). I sent these cookies along with some other LUs to my college son. He called me almost immediately when he received them (and suprisingly it wasn't for money, lol) to thank me. He told me that all his roomates devoured several boxes within just a few minutes. So, these cookies passed the college frat test. Combining it with Amazon Prime shipping and it's all good. Kudos!"
1290,"This offers a quick way for a tasty drink. Fill up a glass of water and squirt as little or as much as the liquid in the glass and viola - peach tea! Yeah, not really peach tea but still tastes pretty darn good. They say 24 uses but I probably got only 15 or so since I either wanted my drink a little sweeter or used too big of glasses.<br /><br />The current price on Amazon suggests more than five dollars a bottle. I think that is pretty steep but I would probably purchase some more individual bottles to try other flavors."
1291,"My kitten, Poppy, liked to steal the lamb based kibble that my dogs ate.  I've always fed the animals the highest quality foods and I went on a search to find a lamb based cat food for him.<br /><br />Acana fits the bill.  The aroma of the kibbles is a bit strong, but he LOVES it.  He changed over from his other kibble (Evo) just fine, litter box odor is absent, which is wonderful with an indoor cat.<br /><br />His coat is super shiny.  His white fur is very white, his black fur is super shiny.  His teeth, ears, everything is in great shape.  Love this food and will keep it in his rotation."
1292,"These cranberries are delicious.  Versatile, I use them to flavor kefir,<br />to snack on, and add them to salads.  Good product.  I appreciate that<br />they are organic and sweetened with apple juice, not sugar."
1293,"I used this on my English Bulldog (white and brindle), American Bulldog (white and brindle) and little mix breed (tan and white).  They all smell GREAT and the white areas really pop.  I couldn't be happier.  The scent lasts a little over a week...my dogs swim in their pool everyday and celebrate by rolling in the grass/dirt, though, so I'm sure it would last longer on less active dogs.  lol  It arrived on time and I would (and do) buy from this seller again."
1294,"Compared to other bagged teas, this is delicious and highly aromatic blend of chai.<br /><br />Right from the opening you will smell the wonderful cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg notes.<br /><br />Although I enjoy it all alone, this probably tastes just as good with milk/sugar but I haven't had to use them to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />Once this cools down a bit, the flavors are more distinct and mellow to my taste.<br /><br />I try not to go past 2.5 minutes while brewing and so far this is working for me. I haven't had any issues with bitterness, etc.<br /><br />Go ahead and play around with brewing length since it can vary based on water temperature and quality.<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant since I've already tried the Jasmine Blossom Green tea from Stash, but this was surprisingly good and is a refreshing alternative to other teas.<br /><br />Give this a shot, you might love it!<br /><br />* * * * * 5 / 5 * * * * *"
1295,The taste is great and allows me to eat peanut butter even when dieting. Can get cheaper from PB2 website though.
1296,I first bought a simular item from the store and my little toy poodle Trustie loved it.  So when I saw this offered in a much larger amount and for the price I had to give it a try.  Well I am glad I did and Trustie is even more so.  When I gave him his first one I found out they are a slight larger than the ones I had bought before.  The thing is after I gave it I was shocked by his excitement because he started chewing and didn't stop but only to go for water and then when it was almost gone.  He then finished it the next night in front of me while I watched TV he chewed.  So all in all I would give these an A+ and I am sure Trustie would agree.
1297,"The product information doesn't tell you that the tea includes processed sweetener (stevia), butterscotch flavoring, and some other processed ingredients.<br /><br />This is not the original recipe for Yogi Tea, though it implies that it is. Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).<br /><br />I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this."
1298,consistency is ok but product is absolutely tasteless - might be possible to add to other cereals but not much fun to eat by itself
1299,"I also love this seasoning and have been using for years.  However, I think that this vendor is over-charging in a major way.  I just bought two 3.5 oz bottles of Beau Monde from my local Von's/Safeway store at $4.19 each.  Then I came back to this entry to see if the bottles were perhaps larger than 3.5 oz but they are not.  So, I have to ask, ""Why is this so expensive at this one online store?"
1300,"I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found."
1301,"I have purchased this pumpkin from Amazon to help my cat lose weight and for baking.  The consistency is, well, for lack of better word, inconsistent.<br /><br />Sometimes we received firm canned pumpkin like the kind I grew up baking with, and other times we received a runny, really messy sort I would call puree.  I contacted the company and they said something about having an extraordinarily wet season.  Never did figure out what that had to do with the processing of the pumpkin...<br /><br />I do not know how other organic pumpkins fare or even if there is competition in the line of product.  Some cans were badly damaged in shipping which was a surprise and quite unfortunate.  Amazon's Customer Service was stellar as always and replaced what was damaged.<br /><br />As far as the consistencies go, if I still have the photos I took of the runny stuff, I will post them.  It's quite different from the firmer canned pumpkin!  I would recommend this for buying a lot of (for cats and dogs when it's a really good price), but honestly I don't use this for baking anymore because I never really know what I'll get."
1302,"This is the worst tasting cola I've ever tried. It has a horrible after-taste that is completly unacceptable. I'm now stuck with a very exspensive machine, that I can make carbonated water with, and replacing the carbonator is around $80.00. Bad purchase."
1303,"I pretty much grew up using bull dog sauce in Japan.  Has a consistency of salad dressing with teriyaki like taste but little more zing.  Kids love it and everyone that tried this sauce was amazed at how good it is.  It goes well with steak, chicken, pork or tonkatsu (breaded fried pork cutlet) and just about anything you can imagine.<br /><br />It does go very well with tonkatsu; panko breaded fried pork cutlets.  It's amazing.  The Japanese will eat with Bulldog sauce but also if you like curry rice, you can use tonkatsu and make it into katsu-curry which is another classic Japanese dish.<br /><br />I know I know, it has HFCS but it sure beats plain and boring A1 steak sauce (though I do use it sometimes but mix different sauce!).  Not to mention like I said, you can use this sauce like teriyaki (or BBQ) sauce with anything so definitely try it out!"
1304,I used to feed my two cats Meow Mix dry food and give them a can of Fancy Feast as a treat when I came home from work.  My male cat started throwing up after he'd eat... it was nasty!  I took him to the vet and she said most likely a food allergy and to put him on Wellness single protein canned food.  It's worked great... he loves it and rarely throws up anymore aside from the occasional hairball.  His sister will only eat dry food so I switched her to Wellness dry and she loves it as well.
1305,"I love, love, LOVE this brand of protein bars...great taste, not to sweet and a lot of nuts in the bars. I really like this particular flavor."
1306,"I love this tea. I love the way my cup smells when the tea is gone.  I don't add a thing except hot water.  It's so-o-o beautiful and delicate and delicious!<br /><br />I originally purchased the tin with the little sachets (they're too delicate to be called ""bags"") through a fundraiser and I FELL IN LOVE!!!!  I had to have more.  Those little sachets are refined and make tea drinking even more elegant than it is... even if I'm drinking it from my pink commuter mug (dedicated to tea drinking, so that no coffee oils can taint it)."
1307,"I am definitely not a coffee connoisseur, but this stuff is bad.  It is a disappointment because I expected a Wolfgang Puck product to have more ""class.""  This tastes artificial and it can't stand alone without tons of cream and sweetener.  Will not buy again!"
1308,I use the cups on a lower cup level.  I make a smaller cup of this to get more flavor.  I've taste better.  I do like Gloris jean's coffee..this flavor is a little dull.
1309,"I'm a big fan of coffee and usually cook more than one cup per day. I used to have french press and stovetop espresso pot to make myself some coffee, and I usually have black coffee without sugar.<br /><br />I just moved to US at May 2011, and needed coffee immediately. At that moment this item was on sale, and I checked the reviews from someone else which gave a lot of compliment for the taste, which was the main reason for me to purchased it.<br /><br />But I was very very disappointed for the stale quality, lack of aroma, and bad taste.<br /><br />People who are familiar with coffee should know that when you cook fresh bean, you expect to create tasty coffee cream and bubbles (sometimes you'll have a lot, just like coke). Poorly this coffee bean only resulted dark brown liquid with bitter flavor, and the month-feel (or tongue-feel) was extremely thin.<br /><br />Few days later I went to costco and bought another beans with similar price, which taste much better than this one. I cooked ""Eight O'Clock Coffee 100% Columbian Whole Bean"" for roughly five times, now I'm very glad to have replacement and totally get rid of it. The rest beans are still preserved in the original package and I put it in my refrigerator. I'll try to exchange for groceries with friends. If nobody wants it, I'll plant flowers with it.<br /><br />Finally, if you want to get coffee with good (or acceptable) taste, this Eight O'clock beans are definitely NOT what you want. If you try to have very cheap beans to serve at a breakout room, you don't care about the taste but need some caffeine, you guys love to add lots of sugar/milk to make a sweat coffee drink, you probably would be satisfied."
1310,I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.
1311,"It is to early for me to give it more than three stars. So far so good, he seems to like it, and it seems to agree with his system. I will do an update later."
1312,"I think I taste more of the mango then the peach but over all I like the Vita Coco water with flavors then just by itself. I am not in the food science world but I think Coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream/ solids from the water part.  What is left is a strong coconut flavored past that is sent somewhere else and coconut water that still has health effects and a very slight coconut flavor.  It also has some weight, or thickness that is heaver then what normal water would be, it reminds me of an egg white viscosity.  Drink it colder the better I say because when warm urp!"
1313,"My 2 year old Shih Tzu boy loves this food.  I mix it along with Health Extensions so he has the benefit of both types and flavors of foods.  He was typically a poor eater, but now just ""woofs"" it down!"
1314,"Red Zinger is the tea that made Celestial Seasonings famous.  This was the must-have tea in the seventies.  Every well stocked hippie cupboard had to have this tea next to the brown rice and soy sauce.  But it is the healthful ingredients and classic flavor that keep it an enduring favorite.  This caffeine-free herbal blend brews up into a tasty ruby potion that smells lemon-mint tart and tastes like minty cherry syrup.<br /><br />Hibiscus is the first ingredient.  First consumed by the ancient Egyptians, Hibiscus tea has diuretic qualities, can lower blood pressure, and has minerals and flavonoids.  The second ingredient, rose hips, are very high in vitamin C and are used in herbal medicine to prevent urinary tract infections.  Other ingredients include peppermint, lemon grass, orange peel, lemon myrtle, licorice and wild cherry bark.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Passion colors all that it touches in its own hues.""  Baltasar Gracian."
1315,"I buy this all the time and drink it just about every day as my special treat.<br />I use soy milk or almond milk with it and it is delicious. I mix it with 3/4 cup hot<br />water and then 3/4 cup of whatever milk you want and then micro-wave again. My sister told me about it. That is how I found it. Then I found I could order ""MOCAFE<br />Precious Divinity Spiced Chai Tea Mix"" from Amazon."
1316,We ordered the Dirty Sue Martini mix and love<br />it. Once you get the amount adjusted to your<br />tastes - Bam - Dirty Sue really kicks it up<br />a notch or even two.
1317,"I had never had Chinese 5 Spice before, and boy, was I in for a really nice surprise! I like all the spices in it~ cinnamon, cloves, fennel, anise, and ginger. Putting them together into one ""5 Spice"" was genius. It's delicious, really. It says on the jar that you can use it on meats and poultry for a Chinese flavor, although I haven't tried that yet. Since I don't use any form of sugar or sugar substitute, I've used it as a sweetener on my plain yogurt or on oatmeal, that type of thing. I use it in place of plain cinnamon many times, for instance, on top of apple sauce or crushed pineapple.<br /><br />The only thing I'd recommend is putting a plastic shaker top onto the jar so you can sprinkle out the 5 Spice. I really don't want to have to either get a measuring spoon out just to use it, or else  have to sprinkle it into my palm and then onto the food. I had to get my own jar with sprinkle top and I don't think I should have had to do that.<br /><br />Other than that packaging detail, this is a great product... HIGHLY recommended!"
1318,This coffee works great for Latte's. Here's how we make it:<br />- Pour 1/3 cup cold milk (Organic 2% works best) into ceramic mug<br />- Add sugar if required<br />- Microwave on high 45 secs (till milk starts to boil)<br />- Froth-up milk using a battery operated stirrer (we bought one real cheap at Ikea)<br />- Prepare K-cup on Medium Setting<br />- Pour over frothed milk & enjoy<br /><br />This recipe makes 2 cups of coffee for one K-cup !<br /><br />You can adjust the amount of milk depending on how strong you like the Latte.<br />Beats Sbucks any day.
1319,"I prefer this veggie bouillon to any I have tried, very flavorful, but I do like my food on the salty side tho (fyi: 1/2 of a cube has 35% of your daily sodium! and does contain MSG).  It makes a very satisfactory gravy.  The price is reasonable, even when you add the shipping, it is comparable to the stores.  Which leads me to the reason I purchased it here...I can no longer find a local store that carries this brand :( and I live in a decent sized city."
1320,"If there is a negative statement to be made it would be that this product makes only one cup at a time. I enjoy my coffee and found that this brand lives up to its description. Besides the flavor, this brand goes the proverbial extra mile in being earth friendly. The packet describes the treatment of the workers and plants as well as states that part of the proceeds go to an organization started by this brand --- Kicks For Causes-- which assists in the development of youth soccer programs. As stated on the package ""the proper place for a child is on the playground, not in the workplace"". A statement we as consumers need to be more mindful about!"
1321,"I KNOW THE OLD SAYING ""TO EACH THEIR OWN"", BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR THIS. BEST WAY I CAN DESCRIBE THIS IS THAT IT TASTED LIKE JARRED SAUCE. SAVE THE MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING FROM YOUR LOCAL GROCER."
1322,I tried these originally as a free sample. I am so impressed that they pack such a huge flavor! Made with real fruit juice these are candies that are sure to make adult and kids happy.
1323,"I love the light blend and Maxwell house doesn't have that bitter taste that the store brand has! I also save the containers, they're great and have many uses! Thanks!"
1324,Outstanding favor! Chocolate extreme! Very smooth and creamy.  If you love chocolate this coffee is a must!  It is my favorite instant coffee.
1325,I came across this bag of jackfruit and had to try it. Really tasty! Not quite 'juicy fruit' (as I've read it described) but like a pleasant blend of every fruit I like. Chewy but not tough.
1326,"I've had many harissas and often have made my own.  While this isn't the worst I've had (that stuff in the yellow tube is), it just doesn't have the robust flavor of a true harissa.  The addition of bell pepper and vinegar make it less versatile and pure if you're looking for the real deal."
1327,"These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.  I set up an entire spread of foods, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, liquids etc to try and when my friends and I allowed the tablets to dissolve, they only worked on a couple things and only for a very short period of time (maybe 5-10 min?)"
1328,I had bought the white powdered cheese (3 bags Land O'Lakes) before and the orange cheese from Barry Farm.<br /><br />My Kids loved both.<br /><br />This was cheaper and I am so used to free shipping from Amazon I went with this for a cheaper per ounce total cost.<br /><br />We used one packet and the kids refuse to eat any more.<br /><br />Buy the white or the orange.
1329,"......BUT, same great taste!  These Kays Naturals Better Balance Protein Parmesan Chips are different though. I have these on Subscribe and Save and the entire old pkge equalled 1.5servings, 165Cals, about 5.2gFat, 16.5 Net Carbs, 15gProtein, 4.5gFiber.<br />  But, this has been changed with the current NEW packaging:<br />NOW<br />  1serving= 1whole bag!<br />And, NOW an ENTIRE bag has<br />120Cals<br />11(Net)Carbs<br />12gProtein<br />2.5gFat<br />4gFiber<br /><br />So, that's probably good news for those of you who didn't want to divvy (sorry, no time to check if this is a valid word per the dictionary) a bag up into 1.5servings and try to compute the nutritional facts for the whole bag.<br />  But, ahhh, a little less protein and that's one of the main factors in purchasing these.  But, still, no complaints:  Overall, a great move!"
1330,This is a good tasting product at a good price and I will buy it again!!
1331,"This is the ""all gone"" treat after dinner.  It's the only treat that the dogs work for; and I did run the chance of losing a hand.  They know a new command now:  ""be gentle"" when taking liver treats."
1332,"A good snack for those late nights when you want something tangy, but don't want to risk gaining five pounds to satisfy the craving. My only suggestion is that you ration the consumption. There's lots of sodium in this treat. Other than that, these lasted yours truly a very long time and prevented a lot of naughty late night snacking."
1333,"This cherry soda tastes strongly of... cherries. That doesn't sound too surprising until you taste this product and compare it to other nominally ""black cherry flavored"" products you may be familiar with. This is the genuine article. It's as unlike Dr. Pepper as beef jerky is unlike Kobe beef.<br /><br />Now, if you think drinking a can of fresh cherry juice would appeal to you, I think you'd probably like this. It tastes bright, natural, and real. But it turns out that large volumes of pure cherry juice just isn't to my personal liking, and I suspect the same would be true of many other adults. I've therefore given this three stars, not for execution (which is flawless) but for concept (which may not appeal to everyone.)"
1334,"The truffles were just as I expected creamy and tasty, plus the price was just right wish is a first for me"
1335,"The product came as discribedand was in excellent shape, fast delivery very exceptional for the price"
1336,"If you're looking for a tasty, silky dark chocolate, this one is a treat.  Nutritionists recommend having an ounce of 70% or above dark cocoa per day.  This has a rich, silky taste and texture.  Not too bitter and not too sweet.  I'm happy with 3 squares of it which is about 60 calories.  I picked mine up locally at the health food store in town and a single bar was over $4.00 to give you a price comparison.  My son was able to find them at Walmart but I don't like driving that far and would order in bulk to keep in the house. These are tasty."
1337,The product was receivede on time and meets my expectations. I tried the coffee this morning and enjoyed it very much.
1338,"Healthy treat,and I enjoy seeing my dogs so excited when I grab the bag!<br />They absolutely love them :)"
1339,"My whole family loves these chips! They go so fast, it is great to get them by the case!"
1340,"I wish I knew how to make these with a bit less salt. ALL my kids want to eat them from the 13 y.o. down to the toddler, but we try to save them for travel or a special snack because they cost so much per pound!<br />They do taste very good. They are more spicy (not hot, just spice) than I had anticipated, but my toddler likes that. If yours doesn't like spice or you don't want them to eat a snack with a higher salt content (for toddlers) I'd skip buying this.<br />I did buy these earlier, but then waited to feed my son until he was old enough to handle the spice."
1341,Excellent selection for the real tea lover. The full flavor of an enriching blend of Ginger and Peach will<br />enliven your senses.
1342,After 1 1/2 months on this food all three of my dogs had dangerous liver readings. After 3 weeks all three went back to normal. this is a dangerous food and can kill your dog be careful. I would not recommend feeding it unless you are willing to pay very high vet bills and lose your dog. the company never responded to my emails or phone calls.
1343,These are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best!  Sad to see on Amazon they are no longer available ;-(<br />Quick shipping and they arrived safely!
1344,If you've ever enjoyed a bratwurst in Germany this is the mustard for you. I've searched for decades to replicate my experience from the 70's in Deutchland and this is it. Great mustard!!
1345,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00438ZXAM"">Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (50 count)</a>My friend always talked about how she orders EVERYTHING on Amazon; and she put me on as a Prime Guest Member.  I have ordered this coffee twice, and it is the best tasting coffee!!  I have tried buying Starbucks ground coffee in the grocery store, but it never had the same taste as when you go into a Starbucks store.  I had been given a trial packet of this stuff, and I am HOOKED.  So happy that I can get it with free shipping, and I look forward to a nice, consistent cup of delicious coffee every morning without the mess of filters and grounds for only 1 cup."
1346,"Martinson's Dark Roast k-cup was a very nice surprise. My only complaint was that it came in a 48-count box. I had never tried this brand and bought it based on other reviewer's comments. Now that I know how good this coffee is, the larger box is not a problem. I prefer a full bodied cup of coffee in the morning and this brew met my needs and is one of my favorites. It is not over-powering, just very good.  I shared this coffee with two friends that have Keurigs and they liked it but said they couldn't find it at the store.  I would definitely buy this again."
1347,"Besides Timothy's, ""Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino Single Serve Cups"" is another favorite K-Cup coffee to drink if your looking to stock up.. Taste fantastic, is just the right strength to get you going when you need to but not so strong where it gives you the shakes.. Highly recomend ""Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino Single Serve Cups"" if your looking for a new K-Cup to try..."
1348,"Product was excellent really seemd to help my dog, however the price was very high for the little amount received. I found a much bigger bag locally at a better rate. Would buy again though!"
1349,Loved it.  I didnt have an airbrush so I just shook it real good and painted it on.  Came out beautiful I had to do a couple coats though.
1350,"It's on the hot side, but it still has good flavor. It came fresh, and when I opened the package and breathed it in I could get that wicked flavor. Respectable price and mass."
1351,"One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like ""I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me"".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the ""Original Donut Blend"" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those ""special"" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]"
1352,Have not received this item so I can't write a review!  Where is it?
1353,"I drink this tea because I love the taste and now, I still enjoy it, even though I was informed that it has some medicinal value, as well."
1354,"My husband and I both like our coffee slightly strong but not bitter. This coffee is very good. If you have a Senseo coffee maker, use the double pod. The pods are very thick."
1355,"We bought this along with the Himalayan Inhaler (which works great).  However this fine ground salt does not work in the inhaler, it comes into your mouth as you breathe.  Use the rock salt instead."
1356,"My big kitty loves mackrel and sardines, but they are hard to find.  I got a can of this to try because he loved salmon, as well--and he got one sniff of it and started howling for it! I could hardly get it from the can onto his plate fast enough!  These are very large cans and too much for one cat or one meal, but I just use a couple tablespoons at a time, and then slip the unused portion into a ziplock baggie and pop it in the fridge.  I take it out about one hour before serving again--still get the same response--the big guy LOVES it!  I always leave extra on his plate so that he can go back to it if he likes, and so far, he has not eaten more of it than his other varieties, just seems to enjoy it the most.  It is healthy and low calorie due to its purer contents, and so I am hoping it will help him to lose a pound or two.  He still eats just a bit at a time, but with so much more gusto--and from the amount of washing up after his meal of this, I can tell that he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Happy cat, happy human!  I am now buying it by the case!"
1357,"Got this pack with my new Cuisinart.  Seems like a good variety of different brands of coffees and teas.  So far have like most things, but some things to note:<br /><br />There's only one type of decaf coffee.  So if you're a big decaf drinker, you may not like this pack.<br /><br />Most of the coffees aren't ""extra bold"" so taste a little weak to me on the 8 oz setting.  If you like your coffee strong, use the 6 oz setting on your machine if it's not ""extra bold"".<br /><br />Tea is good, but also not as strong as I like it.<br /><br />Hot chocolate is just ok.  Be sure to rinse out your machine after you use it."
1358,"I normally buy top quality tuna packed in water from Amazon to avoid the genetically modified soy found in the water packed tuna in the grocery stores.  I also avoid tuna packed in genetically modified cottonseed oil and/or soy oil.<br /><br />This is the first time I've been willing to pay extra for tuna packed in olive oil so I can't compare this brand of tuna in olive oil to the really expensive ones.  It does not specify extra virgin olive oil and I noticed that the oil was quite light in color, but - trusting that it is actually olive oil and not canola sneaked in dishonestly - the flavor was very good.<br /><br />This is delicious, really meaty tuna.  It is packed solid with no ""little fish flakes"" in the can.  All I had to do was chop celery really fine and add a bit of fresh lemon juice and it was as good as - or better than - the tuna salad I make with all kinds of other things in it.<br /><br />The only criticism is that quite a few of the cans were dented, but not enough to make them unusable. This has been a problem with other canned goods ordered from Amazon.  However, to be fair, there are a lot of dented cans of everything on the shelves in my local supermarkets, so I don't think it is necessary an ""Amazon problem"".<br /><br />For a really fast, healthy and delicious meal for one, this tuna is terrific.  I will be ordering it again, for sure."
1359,"does it taste EXACTLY like fattening, sugar-loaded peanut butter? hell to the no!, but it certainly curbs the craving for it if you are a health conscious person, and it is delicious! You add water to achieve the desired consistency. Spread it on bread, use it in protein shakes, sprinkle it on cereal, blend it with fat free cool whip for a peanut butter mousse..., The possibilities are endless!! I would never be without PB2 in my cabinet... EVER!<br />My husband and 14 year old daughter eat it as well, so I have competition:(, Oh well, just have to buy more!"
1360,"Food For Life created Bible bread from the scriptures.  Now they evolve that and use the recipe to make some pasta.  Amazing.  Quick cooking.  Takes about 4 minutes, don't overcook it or it will be rock hard.  Its the softest pasta I've tasted.  Its healthy for you.  I add some oil so it doesn't stick."
1361,"A really strong cup of coffee, just like it says...BOLD! I love rich, strong coffee. This one is definitely an eye opener. Not quite s good of a flavor and aroma as I would like, but I'm very particular. It's a little bitter for my taste."
1362,"We have this delivered monthly from Amazon on the Subscribe and Save program; it's my husband's coffee of choice. Always fresh, always consistent, it's a favorite in our home.  If you like a little extra kick from your coffee, this roast is a nice, milder espresso blend--not too dark and heavy.  Great coffee."
1363,"This is my favorite flavor of the Go lean bars- it's filling, sweet, satisfies craving every time and it's nutritious- all around yumm"
1364,"I have to admit I never tasted Granola before in my 63 years. But after a heart attack I had spent the past 2-3 years as an avid juicer, plus bought a Vitamix & use it faithfully as well. Now this isn't the most healthy of snacks given its 140 calories in a single serving size of 1/4 cup.....but that 1/4 cup goes a LONG way in satisfying any ""treat"" cravings you may have. In the long run it will SAVE you calories as it honestly stops a lot of cravings. I have my serving with a cup of decaf coffee and find I don't even feel the need for breakfast, PLUS feel like I just plain start my morning on the right foot. Kind of nice to begin my day every single day rewarding myself and not feeling like I do it with junk food.<br /><br />  If it had not been for the Vine program I admit I would have gone to my grave never having ever even tasted granola. Now as it turns out I will be ordering this and plan to continue using it as my guilty free snack. Not sure why but I never feel like I am forced to watch my portions since while 1/4 cup sounds small in theory, when eaten it completely satisfies and I never feel like I ""need"" more. This is now one of about a dozen items I have tried on Vine that I end up buying on my own to continue. Even more rare, it EARNS an honest 5 out of 5 stars."
1365,"I recommend this hot cocoa. It tastes rich and decadent, but it's healthy (no sugar added, sweetened with stevia). I had similar drinks at Whole Foods, and this is on par. In addition, most of the ingredients are organic (milk for example), so one more reason for good review. Pretty much the quality and taste you'd expect from the Now brand."
1366,"These blueberries are better than I expected, they are soft in texture and not the typical dry chewy texture of most dried fruit. Excellent on salads and in baking. I will definitely be ordering more."
1367,"These Lean Treats were initially recommended by my vet. I have a large dog, and the larger-sized treats, which I purchased for $6 (12 oz)  from my vet, are large enough to hide pills in, and also to tear into smaller pieces for training. I ordered these treats as replacements, thinking I was getting a bargain. HOWEVER the shipping cost was over $6 for a 4 oz pkg!!!! The pkg contents were not accurately described, as the size of the treats were appropriate for tiny dogs like chihuahuas. The pkg image is blurred, it shows a large dog, a dalmatian, and so further misleads the consumer. So, while the treats are great, the images and the descriptions need to be clarified. I won't order online again until this is cleared up. Perhaps if there were actual size pictures of the treats, that might help."
1368,"As soon as I received Starbuck's Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I brewed up a few cups.  This is conveniently packaged, since one can scoop out what one wants, and re-seal the package for the refrigerator.<br /><br />I use a Chemex coffee maker because it's all glass, and uses a quality laboratory-quality filter, so off-flavors are minimized.  This lets the coffee flavor shine through.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is apparent from the time one opens the package, with the wonderful smell of vanilla wafting up to your nose.  Brewing it is a breeze; it's got a good blend size that permits the Chemex to function very well, and percolate through the coffee quickly.<br /><br />The flavor and taste of coffee is why we drink it.  And here the Starbucks comes through fine.  But beware; this is not overly cloying flavor masking the taste of the coffee; instead, the vanilla flavor adds to the coffee taste, rather than overwhelming it, as you can get in those 'international flavor' instant coffees.<br /><br />Recommended.  This is a full-flavored coffee, perhaps even more on the dark-roasted side (at least that was the flavor to me).  I'm more of a fan of the regular roast, so it was a bit heavy for me.  Even so, it was a nice cup of coffee.  And if one is a full-bodied roast fan, this would be very, very good.  Four stars for the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Coffee."
1369,"I love this product.  Pero is so satisfying and full bodied, richer than a cup of coffee with no caffeine.  I love that it contains chickory which is so good for the GI track, removes constipation and great for the liver.  A lovely drink that is so healthy and good for you.  I love starting my day with a hot cup of Pero.  Completely satisfying with milk and sweetner."
1370,"I have just ended a 2+ year custody battle. Needless to say I have anxiety & I'm set off at the slightest thing. Then this little miracle fell into my lap. I was prepared for disappointment- didn't happen! The anxiety & edginess I had become all too familiar with has vanished. This affect is achieved with your very 1st dose. I now feel calm, literally. I no longer feel agitated. I no longer bite peoples head off. AND to top it all off I am sleeping soundly through the night EVERY night. No waking up, no tossing & turning, just solid, sound sleep. Thank you FIRST Magazine for this reccommendation!"
1371,"So often the K-cup format brews up a weak cup of coffee, but not this one.  Plenty strong and great flavor. Love it.  (And sad that it is currently unavailable from Amazon!)"
1372,I lost over 125 pounds on Weight watchers and I ate one (or two) of these truffles most every day.  It's a nice little reward at the end of a day when you deserve a treat.  Less than a point for one!
1373,I did not care for this gum at all. There is much better gum available. It lost the flavor in just a few minutes.
1374,My 3-year old loves these!! It is nice to see her enjoying something she is allowed to eat since she was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in December. I can't keep enough of these in the house.
1375,"PROS - Wheat Thin Reduced Fat crackers taste great for a low fat cracker! We've tried other low fat brand crackers and think this one is the best low fat.<br /><br />CONS - This is not a con for the cracker, but for AMAZON. Ordered the pack of 6 with the Subscribe & Save special price. Received the crackers on 1/26/11... BUT, the Best Used/Expiration date on the crackers is 2/20/11, in just 24 days!! So they've been sitting in a warehouse for a long time.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE - The crackers and price were very good; but beware of possible short expiration dates on food when ordering from Amazon, especially if it's multiple packs and you might not use them right away."
1376,"What you see in the picture is EXACTLY what you get. All the snacks are equivalent to what is in the picture, everything under them is packing peanuts and paper. Horrible disappointing."
1377,"Started mixing this in with my furry persons' regular commercial brand, hoping they wouldn't notice too much and still eat it. No problems there! They loved it from bite one, and now are at the point where their former dry food has been entirely phased out and they're just eating Indigo Moon as their dry food (I'd come across Indigo Moon at a local furry-person store).<br /><br />Within two weeks of starting to feed them Indigo Moon, both my cats' fur have become thicker, shinier, and softer with almost no shedding (whereas before, there had been plenty of shedding - even the dandruff problem with one of them has cleared up) and they also seem to have increased energy (both are five years old).<br /><br />Many dry foods promise ""100% nutrition"" results, but this one delivered even better than I'd hoped for. My cats look even more gorgeous and seem healthier. This is a keeper, especially at its price, which ran about ten dollars less than the other premium feline brands where I purchased it."
1378,"I was familiar with the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut K-Cups, but couple that with the ""subscribe and save"" option, and you have an outstanding combination!"
1379,"Not very sweet. Very bland, and in my opinion too expensive for the product. Flavorless, doesn't taste like you're having a treat but the amount of carbs is high."
1380,This looks like great dog food and the ingredients are good. Sadly my Cocker Spaniel does not care for it at all. She's been on it for 3 months and I'm going to try a new product as her itching is still bad and she leaves most of this in her bowl.
1381,"Of course, reviewing something for taste is about as subjective as it gets-- but I can only say that this wasn't my favorite. I normally use breadcrumbs and fry pork on the stove, but I liked giving baking a try. The flavor of the pork worked out just fine, but I wasn't crazy about the Shake 'N' Bake seasonings. I prefer my old breadcrumbs.<br /><br />You can just put the seasonings in a Ziploc bag and shake them on as suggested, or just put the seasonings into a dish and coat the pork that way. It's certainly simple enough either way, a healthier alternative to frying, and doesn't require a lot of clean-up. Three people ate this and all gave sort of a mild thumbs-up. I wouldn't eat it again, but I liked it enough to try the chicken flavor next."
1382,"For my father's 85th birthday, I wanted to delight him with his favorite dessert, pineapple upside down cake. He received instead chocolate duos. I will not order from this company again. They are unreliable."
1383,"My kids love these healthy snacks! No added chemicals and are made of healthy fruits. I freeze these and throw one in their lunchbox and by lunch time, they have a grape slushy!"
1384,"Absolutely tasty beverage.  The price is kind of high after shipping, but if you're a fan of the show, this is definitely a must."
1385,"For the flavor, I will give it 5 stars. No need to explain. The coffee is Irish Creme without alcohol. So nice....<br />However, the packaging is bad. I give it 0 stars.<br />So over all, I rated it 3 stars.<br />192 creamer cups are loose in the big brown box. After long way to our door, some creamers are leaking and made other creamer cups sticky. All 192 creamer cups came in with brown manufacturer box instead of the one showing on the Amazon product page (please refer to the pictures I shared). Besides, the shelf life should be 6 months according to the customer service from International delight, but I ordered on May 29, 2011. The package was received on June 3, 2011. However, the creamer Expired on 08/10/11. I only have 2 months to consume 192 creamers.<br />I guess it is why the price is good. Something needs to be sacrificed!"
1386,Yum!  Makes a great watermelon margarita like they serve at Long Horn Steak house.  Tastes like a watermelon Jolly Rancher.<br /><br />1/2 oz. Grenadine<br />4 oz. Sweet & Sour<br />1/2 oz. Monin Watermelon Syrup<br />1 oz. Don Julio<br />1 oz. Watermelon Smirnoff
1387,"Those of you who love black licorice or anise flavor - this is it! This tea is so flavorful and aromatic, it's intense. In my opinion, the addition of sweetener is not necessary! Good for your daily diet but remember this is not a wimpy tea, it's full bodied. And great for your digestive system. Love, Love, Love this tea :)"
1388,Could not find this product in stores or Jello web site.  Amazon had it so glad they did.  This puddig taste like no other and is the best!
1389,"I have an 18 month old who only has 4 teeth. Needless to say, she still eats a lot of pureed foods. She can eat cereal, which she usually has for breakfast with fruit, however she's gotten bored with it. I got her some of these Earth's Best Oatmeals, which adds some variety to her breakfasts. She seems to like it a lot. I heat it up for 20 seconds in the microwave to make it warm oatmeal. I like the fact that this oatmeal has a lot of iron in it, which is necessary for a growing toddler!!"
1390,"Love this tea.  Couldn't find it anywhere, and pregnant won't drink anything else.  Add a little honey and lemon."
1391,"PG Tips is by far my favorite tea. The taste lives up to its outstanding reviews in every way, but the fine grind of the loose tea was not what I expected. This is not what I would call loose tea; instead, it is tea dust. It makes for a cloudy, murky brew (looks like a mud puddle). I guess I could use paper filters, but for me the point of loose tea is that I can eliminate the need for the filter. Not only for environmental reasons, but because tea and coffee just taste better when brewed without paper filters. Against all odds, though, the tea still tastes great. Just a little hard to get past the aesthetics. oh well. I suppose there could very well be a good reason for the fine grind."
1392,"Very good cup of coffee.  Not as strong as some of the expresso or french roast brands which I also enjoy; so when you want something that has some body too it that's not that strong, then this is an excellent choice."
1393,my dogs love these-easy to break apart to tailor the size. they go to town eating these treats. this makes them very happy which makes my wife very happy which makes me...life is good.
1394,"We found this at BJ's before I started shopping on Amazon.  My wife and I were disappointed with it after having tried the Twinings in the sample pack that came with our brewer.  The Twinings is much smoother and balanced than the Bigelow.<br /><br />When I wrote this, Amazon was out of the Twinings and only one vendor was selling it at nearly double the normal price.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5WZ4"">Twinings Earl Grey Tea K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2)</a>"
1395,This seems to be very good quality saffron. I have been cooking with saffron from the supper market for a few years now and I can tell this is definitely a lot<br />higher quality. I recommend it.
1396,"love, love, love it. Very fresh taste of chocolate on every kernal & extremly crunchy. I don't really taste the caramel though but the flavor is still so good I don't even care. You get 5 packages in each box and each package holds 2 large handfuls. If you hold it in your hand for more than a few seconds before putting it in your mouth the chocolate will start melting so put it in your mouth right away as you take it out of the package. I love popcorn and usually eat 3 to 4 popped quarts at a time so it's too expensive for me to buy but it sure was good......."
1397,"I bought this dog toy in the smaller size, with great anticipation of finally having something that my 1/2 Yorkie-1/2 Shih Tzu wouldn't chew up and destroy in one afternoon.  From that standpoint, I would say the toy was a success, because it actually took him about 24 hours to eat the ends out of the toy, nab the treat disk and be done with it.  &lt;sigh>  I'm still on the hunt for SOMETHING that Buddy can't destroy.  This, unfortunately, was not it."
1398,"I love this stuff and will soon start buying it from here--you can't beat the price.<br /><br />I add this to ""pre-chocolated"" milk, muahahaha.  This makes milk taste rich, but not to the extent where it becomes over-powering.<br /><br />You've got to love the malt in it, too."
1399,"These crackers are the best I've tried so far.  If I didn't have celiac's disease, I'd buy a non-gluten-free cracker, but am very pleased with the consistency (softer than others I've tasted) of this gluten free cracker and it doesn't have that ""peppery"" taste that most others have.  They're great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack."
1400,"This product is a celiac's dream!  Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.  They are extremely soft, and, accordingly, some flavors do tend to be a tad ""crumbly"", e.g. ginger.  Lemon is not crumbly."
1401,"I like simplicity when it comes to food and I bought these because they have less ingredients than a lot of its competitors. These taste good and are great for a quick fix! Also, Amazon has the best price around.<br /><br />For those of you looking for energy, energy here means calories, not a burst of energy. It's to replenish and keep you from crashing; it's not intended to make you feel like you are on speed!"
1402,"Best K-cup hot cocoa on the market, bar none. Would not be without it in the house, especially with the winter months coming."
1403,"I have been a vegetarian for 15 years and have a meat eating husband.  For years, I have been looking for a good ground beef substitute.  I finally found one.  This one had a good taste and texture when cooked.  My meat eating husband is even happy with it when I use it.  One of the things I love is that I use this to make meatballs, and they stay together.  In the past, they never stayed together.  This is a great product, and I'm happy I found it."
1404,"This is an awesome selection of decaf coffees!  I can't wait to try them all.  If you are looking for variety or a way to try the many different flavors of k cups, this is for you.  Will definitely purchase again."
1405,"All the candy was fresh.  The items packaging is a bit generic, but other than that it was fantastic trip down memory lane."
1406,"I thought this fish oil would be a great supplement for my cats after one of them began to overgroom and created bald patches on her stomach and legs. All four of my cats refused any type of food with this fish oil added. I tried for many days in many ways. Finally switched back from a newer dry food I thought would be better for them, back to their old dry food, which obviously had more oils in the ingredients. Bald cat is getting her fur back."
1407,"A wonderful surprise for the mouth. A gooey, crunchy, chocolately mix of a mess.  If you like your snacks over the top, then this is it.  I had these delivered to my job and offered some to a few co-workers, who raved and raved, and I quickly hid the canister in my drawer ...LOL ... salty, sweet, gooey, crunchy -- heaven!"
1408,WOW!!!I was excited to see that Amazon has Marge's Bakery Goods.<br />I have been getting  their breads from whole foods for a while now.<br />What a great gift and they are Vegan.<br />THEY ARE THE BEST!!!!!!
1409,"I love these cookies.  Can't find them in my home state, but I'm glad they're available through Amazon.com.  The cookies have a ginger-flavored muffin texture, and are covered by a thin layer of dark chocoate.  They're not too sweet, and are a lovely, rare treat."
1410,"liked the flavor and aroma of the coffee a lot! The only drawback is that it comes in a bag that has to be cut open, then needs to be put in a baggie of some sort to be kept fresh. A better design would be to ship the product in a resealable bag or container of some sort. The difference in price between this and the plastic pods makes it worthwhile."
1411,"Sorry, the flimsy bowls are terrible you cannot pick them up and are not easy to handle. My favorite was Orville Tender White in the bag, they should offer both, but it appears Orville has switched to bowls only which you cannot pass to another person. I regret that I have switched to Jolly Time White and Buttery, Crispy White and any other brand still offered in bags! :("
1412,"The tea was great. It was used by my husband and mom, and tasted by me :o) It goes great with fresh mint thrown in with the brew!"
1413,"I do like how these taste but there is too much dietary salt. I also found that after eating two, I began to get stomach knots."
1414,Awesome bars/have eaten these daily for several years/full of fruit like cranberries and raisins with pumpkin seeds/quick energy and protein really sustains you
1415,"This product was not HORRIBLE, but I feel cheated. It looked so good, and the price of $4.99 for a small jar suggested there were some great add-ins. NOT.<br /><br />The berry nut flavor is basically average-tasting crunchy peanut butter with some tough, dried cranberries thrown in. I was hoping the ""nut"" was a walnut, pecan, or almond (or all of the above!), but it's merely an unimpressive sliver of regular old peanut. After I got done picking the hard cranberries out of my teeth, I decided I would never by this flavor of overpriced, disappointing peanut-butter again."
1416,"I'm really disappointed in this tea.  It's got really, really strong tobacco and earthy (read: barnyard) flavors.  I've decided to use it as a filler with some other bulk tea I have . . . its the only way I can use this tea.<br /><br />I will not purchase this tea again, nor will I suggest it to anyone I like.  I'd rather shell out the few extra bucks for a better tasting keemun and drink it less often, than drink this stuff daily.  Insert ""Sad Trombone"" sound effect here."
1417,Good stuff. Hard to find in stores. Found my Strawberry Fluff while I was surffing Amazon.com. Not a bad price. The USE BY DATE on the jars were OCT.2013. Shipping was fast & my 4 JARS of fluff were packed well.
1418,"As a bachelor who frequently must grab a cup of joe at home and run, i was reluctant to waste coffee in my Braun drip machine, and disinclined to clean up after the French Press method.  A New York Times article convinced me that a Pod system would be the way to go, and i found the Philips Senseo machine to be the best at the consumer level.  Alas, the Douwe Egberts pods that come with are, um, IMHO, not good.<br /><br />A brief web search led me to Aloha Island's Senseo-style pods, and i ordered a box of their single serving espresso pods.  The package arrived swiftly, and the box of pods was swaddled in styro-peanuts:  nice touch!  i immediately placed a pair in the Senseo unit and let it do its thing.  Wow!  The quality of the coffee is, to date, unparalled.  Rich, smooth, and frothy, almost like a latte before the milk is added.  And i was surprised that the yield was about one ounce greater than with the DE pods.<br /><br />I'm a believer, an advocate, and a confirmed drinker and fan.  Thanks and Mahalo!"
1419,I'm not a huge tea fan but this is one of my favorites. I think the taste is very subtle and honey compliments it well. Next time I'll add some lemon slices or maybe an orange slice. Yummy!
1420,"This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sail under a false flag, by putting ""Tea&Honey"" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ..."
1421,"I have used this product before and it is excellent.  Unfortunately, when this shipment arrived the seal on the item was broken and some of the product had already been squirted out of the container into the lid.  I can't use it and according to Amazon's policies (pressurized container) I can't return it.  I can't even request a replacement to be sent - very unimpressed with Amazon."
1422,"I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour. Goes great with raw sugar and splash of non fat milk."
1423,I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.
1424,"Received my vanilla beans very quickly.  They arrived fresh, sealed well and exactly as we'd hoped."
1425,"...okay you know the rest /// you might pick up some BEAN-ZYME on amazon.com if you buy this much BEAN.  Ha ha... I did.  Great deal for ORGANIC and delivered right to my home.  I hate to cook - even if it means boiling beans so this is a real life saver.  I'm happy... the beans are deep dark black, firm and DELICIOUS.  Love the cans... no rush to use them.  Thanks for reading."
1426,"Since my sugar has been high, I have been trying to use sugar substitutes and this is what I use now for baking and cooking. Love Love my Stevia Packets.<br /><br />Ps: Along with managing my sugar intake, my sugar level was normal range yeah!"
1427,My daughter is 22 months old and can finish off a pouch in less than 30 seconds.  She just loves these!
1428,Yummy!  I have such a hard time finding the Ranch flavor in the local supermarket.  My product arrived quickly and in great shape!
1429,"I have two little power chewers (under 20 pounds each) who can tear through a regular rawhide roll in a couple of hours. After three days they each could only manage to eat about one fourth of a roll. These rolls are gigantic compared to the regular 10"" rolls I have been giving them. I had to cut them in half to make them easier for my dogs to handle. Usually, my dogs strip off large pieces of a rawhide roll but they couldn't do that with these rolls, the hide is too thick (it ranges from about 1/8"" to 1/4"" thick). Four of these rolls lasted for about a month with two small dogs chewing on them for about two hours every day."
1430,"My kids go through this apple juice like it's going out of style.  In fact I need to order more.  It's organic which is great and no sugar added, because fruit doesn't need help.  Definitely a must in our house."
1431,"This is one of my favorite sweeteners, along with Equal, as they don't leave a bad aftertaste like Sweet 'N' Low.  A lot of debate on its ""safety"", but unless something definitive comes out of a couple of well done research papers I'll keep using it."
1432,"This stuff is amazing- I love water and drink a lot of it but I don't really do the sweet flavored drinks...this has just enough flavor without being overpowering. I take one to the gym every day and it is so tasty and calming...you won't like it if you are not a big mint fan but for me, it was a gem of a find!!"
1433,We use this seasoning product in most everything that needs a vegetable touch.  It enhances dishes from eggs to salads.  It was not found in our local store .  It was almost an after thought to look for to online.  There it was!  It is also very convenient to have it delivered in the four pack.  It comes just as we are using the last little bit.
1434,"Several cans I received were dented, three were so severely dented, I had to throw them out.  I work in food safety, so I know the possible dangers of dented cans."
1435,I received it today. Only got 126 inside. Not 150 as it is marked on the tag. The taste is all right.
1436,"Although these are way more fun than regular white or yellow corn chips, they taste pretty much the same as any other color of natural corn tortilla chips.  These chips are blue because the type of corn they are made from naturally grows blue - there's no blue dye here!  Garden of Eatin' is my favorite brand for chips, because they put so much  thought into all their products, from the organic corn to the cold-pressed oils.  They even use filtered water!<br /><br />The chips I got were all really fresh, delicious, and crunchy, except for one bag out of 12, which had a good date, but tasted a bit stale.  To my surprise, not many of the chips got broken during shipping, although I'm not sure I'll be that lucky to get unbroken chips everytime I order these.<br /><br />If you've never tried these, I suggest getting just one bag from a local store, and wait to order from here till you know you like them.  If you already know you like blue chips, get them here, as this price is unbeatable."
1437,"It's always good to have a Jack Link's in my pocket in case I get a bit hungry. And, it's better to eat this than a hamburger"
1438,"Supposedly increases milk production? Yeah, I didn't see a difference after drinking this for a good 3+ weeks. Aside from that, it doesn't smell or taste very good. Very herbal medicine-like."
1439,"Boxes arrived in new condition in a nifty sealed amazon cardboard box with a label ""ready to ship"".  Looked all good, until I read the Best if used by date on the bottom of each of the boxes - would have been nice to know I was getting a convenient retail price on expired product.  Code on bottom is NOV0912800  09:18, not an expert but it would appear that this stuff is 2 years out of date."
1440,Have used this salt for many many years and everyone just loves it.  Also put it in gift baskets for friends and family.  If you haven't yet............do try it.
1441,"I purchased this tin of saffron for my wife's birthday. Yes, a birthday present. She happens to be a professional chef who always knew the value of high quality ingredients.  Using top-quality -- and yes, this is the best you can buy -- saffron enhances so many spanish foods, risotto and a whole lot of other dishes. You always dissolve saffron in a liquid so that the intense aroma infuses the entire dish and mixes in subtle ways with other flavors. And since you need so little, this tin will last for years. There is simply no substitute. If this is your first purchase of top quality saffron, you will be impressed and wonder how you could ever cook without."
1442,"For those who want to try cooking in the Mayan style this spice is a must for making Cochinita Tacos.  It's a tough seed to work with, but a coffee grinder makes short work of turning it into a powder for marinating pork."
1443,I am so happy I read the reviews here! I had bought a red curry paste from another brand before and I was very disappointed with the results but then I started reading the reviews here and decided to give this one a try and I am thrilled I did. This paste has very good flavor and I feel that the heat is just enough for me and my husband. I absolutely loved it and I am happy that I got the 12 pack. Now I am set for a while.
1444,"Here's another 4.4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal ""regular"" price. At that standard per pound price, you could be buying the juiciest prime filet mignon and get to watch man's best friend become even a better best friend! Wake up Amazon!"
1445,"I chose this as my son's first food.  He loves it.  It was a great transition from being nursed, to mixing expelled milk with this cearal."
1446,"This sauce really does pack a punch. I always considered myself to have a high heat tolerance, but this stuff really puts it to the test! The primary culprit is obviously the Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper), but Ashley Foods added some Habanero and Peri Peri peppers for good measure.<br /><br />This also contains evaporated cane juice which adds a sweetness that is almost fruity or reminiscent of BBQ sauce. Combine all this with the garlic, vinegar, and other spices and you have an exceptional combination that briefly offers you a wonderful taste, and then it steals your soul with a raging inferno of hellfire.<br /><br />If you're looking for something really hot that actually has good flavor as well, then this is the best bet for your money. You could always go with something like pure capsaicin, but you'd be missing out on good flavor.<br /><br />The price might seem steep for a 5 fl ounces, but you likely won't be going through this bottle as quickly as you would some tabasco sauce."
1447,"I got a pretty good deal on these locally with a store sale and coupon. I did not enjoy it very much. The broth was very salty/garlic-y and I could hardly see any chicken in the cup. The lip on the container makes it hard to get everything out. These would be okay for kids. For my money <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EFBMD0"">Progresso Soup, Chicken Noodle Soup, 15.25-Ounce Microwavable Bowls (Pack of 6)</a> are better."
1448,i totally love this protein shake there is no weird taste no after taste NO shakes and it actually keeps me full and gives me great energy!!! i def recommend to everyone!!!!
1449,"To give some background, I'm an espresso geek.  I like my coffee bold, and strong, so trying to drink normal coffee (especially of the instant variety) is like giving a whiskey junkie a glass of Kahlua and milk.  So with that in mind, take note that my definition of ""weak"" may be very different from yours.  Anyway, let me start with my review.  Taster's Choice is meant to be made in 6oz portions.  I filled my standard sized 12oz (The Who!) coffee mug around 3/4 to the brim, so I may have over filled it a bit. (READ UPDATE BELOW)  That being said, Taster's Choice would only provide you a half-full mug of coffee if you followed their instructions properly.  The coffee tasted similar to what you would find at a cheap gas station.  It can only be described as similar to Crystal Light packets, in that your water doesn't exactly taste like Gatorade, but it surely doesn't taste like water either.  I tried adding a few tablespoons of flavored coffee creamer to see if it improved the taste, and it did in a big way.  The flavor was then similar to what you would receive out of those automated ""cappuccino machines"" that you would find in gas stations and breakrooms. (You know, the ones that tell you to only fill up the cup 3/4 of the way because the machine keeps flowing coffee even after you let go of the button?)  If you have ever tasted the ""cappuccino"" out of those machines, you'd know that it isn't anything like cappuccino, but it doesn't taste horrible.  It's drinkable, and has a sweet kick to it.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I'm sure that using two packets would improve the flavor of a 3/4 full mug greatly, so I'm probably going to try that next time around and update my review. (READ UPDATE BELOW) I'm sure that some people would find this useful as a ""fast food coffee"".  It's not great, but it's not bad either, and it provides a little jolt for someone who doesn't have the time to brew a whole pot.<br /><br />*UPDATE*:  I have now tried it with two packets in 8 ounces of water, and it is MUCH better.  It now tastes like quite a bold flavorful coffee.  Highly recommend that you use two packets for each cup."
1450,"I have loved Kettle Brand Sea Salt and Vinegar chips since the first time i tried them.  The fact that i was able to find them on-line for such a great price, was wonderful.  I would definitely make the purchase again.  THey are a quick and simple snack for lunch and it goes great with my cold sandwich."
1451,"I bought both the Blueberry and Strawberry versions of these through Amazon's Subscribe & Save Program. I shop at Costco a lot and have been disappointed that they only carry the Frosted variety of toaster pastries. I refuse to pay the grocery store prices for a treat like this so, for years, I've done without. Both Strawberry and Blueberry are good but I find the Blueberry to have more fruit flavor than the Strawberry. Either way, if you're like me you'll enjoy this product and, the Amazon Subscribe & Save price is quite reasonable too!"
1452,"GREAT COOKING OIL AND GREAT FOR DIPPING, ALTHOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT FROM GRISTEDES, MUCH LESS AND MUCH FASTER SERVICE SO I HEAR. BOUGHT IT FROM ANOTHER SELLER AND PAID ALMOST 2X THE AMOUNT WILL CHECK PRICES NEXT TIME (AND LISTEN TO MY DAUGHTER)"
1453,"The bags come wrapped 4 in a little packet, 10 packets to a box, 6 boxes total.  The packets can easily travel with you.  One also helps me see exactly how many cups of tea I've had in a day!  Start out with one packet opened in the AM.  When it is finished, I know I've made 4 cups of tea."
1454,The Numi Mint tea is very good.  It has a nice flavor.  In the summer we mix it with other herbal teas and water.  We put the container in the sun to sun brew.  It is very good.
1455,"I don't have a lot to say.  It is good, if not great, and the price is reasonable.  I don't taste any vanilla, but that's not a biggy to me.."
1456,"When I recently took a trip to NYC, I bought a pack of these at a market. They have that great balance of tartness and sweetness along with a great chewiness that us gummy connoisseurs seek. I bought five bags when I returned home, as these are not sold in the area where I live. I gave a couple bags away. The others did not last long."
1457,"Coffee is excellent. I always combine 2 different 8 o'clocks when I grind. Hower, I bought this on ""subscribe and save"". 2nd shipment was $7.30 more expensive than previous.<br />I was also not ready for another bag - but shipment notification came when I was out of the country.<br />I received a 40 oz. bag NOT 33 oz."
1458,Works amazingly. My friends and I volunteered and donated cat toys for a local animal shelter. We put stuffing and cosmic catnip in socks. The cats loved to play with it. The smell is not horrible like some catnip either.
1459,"First, let me tell you, I am a ""mom"" and not a typical consumer of Pop Tarts.  My kids, love them, but I have a hard time buying them when I see the sugar and calories. However, these are FANTASTIC!  When I looked in the pantry and saw we only had one package left, I had to try them with a cup of coffee. I was incredibly happy with the sweet crispy morsels!  Just enough to satisfy a sweet tooth and not enough to break the scale tomorrow morning!  I am really happy and just came to Amazon to order the chocolate. I think I may have to just hide this stash from the kids!  I hope you can keep my secret!!!"
1460,"I have gotten this product before a number of times, as we use it frequently. It is so much better price-wise than the markets. I only gave it 4 stars this time, because of the packaging. It was sent via the Post Office, before it was always UPS. Somewhere along the route, the box practically fell apart and had to be taped up by the postal carrier on our route. Also, a couple of cans were dented in pretty good. Of course, it's hard to tell who was faulty here, but I won't stop buying the soup. A good deal!"
1461,"I have looked for the Sardines and Mackerel for weeks.... My cat Ramses was not happy... I was so pleased to find this available!  The kitty food came quickly and was much appreciated!  Ramses wants to personally thank you for carrying his favorites... meow, meow, MEOW!!"
1462,I have tried several gluten free brownie mixes that are super easy to make and really pretty darn good so my opinion of these brownies is influenced by the fact that I have made some great mixes. These are really good and convenient because they are ready-made but I would say that my ultimate favorite is the Gluten Free Pantry mix. I would compare these more with the Trader Joe's gluten free mix which is really good as well.
1463,"okay, it's true our dog was used to the few stale varieties of dog food available in our remote location, but I still think it's the quality of this dog food she likes.  At any rate, she eats it all immediately.  She looks better, her hair is shinier, and she seems to feel better.  So if she were voting I think she'd give it a paws-up."
1464,"My little boy (3 1/2 yrs. old) just loves Goldfish. I'm not sure where he got it, perhaps the grandparents. In any case, I have trouble with him in a little store I go to because they have a display of Goldfish cartons and we can't get by it without getting one. Any of you with kids probably understand. Well, now he loves Goldfish Colors and that probably also goes back to Grandpa. In any case, now Goldfish aren't good enough and Goldfish Colors are the only thing that will do. Fortunately, the store has some 6.6-ounce bags of them, so every time we're there we have to pick one up. Oh well, I enjoy Goldfish too so there's never any problem in getting rid of them. Personally, I grew up on Cheezits, but I like Goldfish just as well. Now I notice the Goldfish bag has a little notice in the upper left-hand corner that specifies the colors are from natural ingredients. That's good as I don't trust all dyes.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
1465,I have 2 large dogs who I allow to lick this every day. They seem to like it.  It must smell and taste good to them.  I like giving this to them as a treat for doing something good instead of something with a higher calorie content.
1466,My husband uses this sugar since he is a diabetic.  He likes it in his coffee and tea.  It dissolves easy.  It is better than using anything that isn't aspartame.
1467,"We recently bought a snow cone machine for my daughter.  I wanted to join in the fun, but I have been on a low-carb diet for almost 2 years.  I noticed there were a number of manufacturers making sugar-free snow cone syrups, but I chose Jelly Belly because I assumed that they would make a great-tasting syrup.  I was not dissappointed.  This one tasted as good as I have ever tasted a sugar-free product.  I have since ordered several other of their sugar-free flavors.  Thank you Jelly Belly."
1468,"I was a little skeptical after looking at the list of ingredients, but I decided to give this tea a try anyway.  I'm glad I did.  It's a delicious, sweet-tasting blend that's good both hot and iced.  I went through about a box a week; everyone I've served it to has enjoyed it."
1469,"Glucerna Bars of all flavors are super for us who have Diabetes, or even for those who are trying to watch their calories."
1470,"Agree with previous review; not much of a oatmeal cookie.  Cannot really taste or see much oatmeal; however, a really good tasting chocolate chip cookie. So not all bad. Gave 4 stars because took a long time to receive. Was concern about the heat with oatmeal and the chocolate chips. If wants a good tasting chocolate chip cookie with a little taste of oatmeal, this is your cookie."
1471,"I love Sesmark Rice Thins!  I have intolerances to wheat, dairy, soy and eggs.  So, finding a cracker that does not contain either of these are hard.  So, I found out about Sesmark about 5 months ago and every since then, I have been hooked.  So, if you have intolerances but still crave something crunchy, slightly salty, then the Sesmark Rice Thins are for you."
1472,I love these. The Hazlenut are my most favorite flavors. They have this outer chocolate shell and as you bite into the round chocolate sphere this yummy creamy chocolaty hazlenutty flavor comes out. This is a more expensive chocolate than that plain chocolate bars that you can buy at the check out aisle in the grocery store; but so worth it.
1473,This is the only treat my dogs like.  We have been happy with the quality and manufacture of of the Chewy Louie dog bones.
1474,"I buy these bars 5 boxes at a time.  I feed them to my 1 and 3 year olds for a night time snack or an on the go 'get by until supper' snack.<br /><br />They love many of the flavors, but banana and peanut butter & jelly are their favorites (well...according to my 3 year old...b/c 1 year old can't talk and eats everything!).  My favorites are banana and lemon.<br /><br />I use them as part of my diet routine.  I keep one with me at all times so that I never get tempted to hit a drive thru.<br /><br />These bars are not exactly a Ho-Ho or Twinkie, but they do taste great and are a good manageable healthy treat to your day!!<br /><br />I tell everyone about them!  Their limited ingredients make me feel good about giving them to my kids!"
1475,"This is a pretty good candied ginger. I'm not a big fan of ginger, but my husband is, and this hits the spot for die-hard ginger fans. And even though I'm lukewarm on ginger, I admit I enjoy a bite of this from time to time. It's chewy, tender, and has a good flavor. And these folks deliver fast. I've ordered a few times from them already, and the supply comes in so quickly you don't even get time to wonder when your shipment is coming in."
1476,I have just done on a wheat free diet and was missing some of the stander snacks.  well these brownies were so good that my grandson didn't know the different.  Now I can offer food that the grand kids will eat.  Thanks!!!!!
1477,I thought I remember having these mints years ago and thought they were great.  They are fresh and have a nice jelly flavored center.  It's been about 10 years since i last ate one of these mints and now find them too sweet for my taste.  Excellent product but I wouldn't purchase again.
1478,"My company had a celebration where this was one of the snacks served. I had one of them and was excited because these are a lot of my favorite nuts in one pouch, which is hard to find. The first thing I did after the celebration was go on Amazon to subscribe to get these regularly. However, I should have looked at the picture more closely before I ordered because when they arrived I was disappointed to find out that the hazel nuts had been ""replaced"" by walnuts. Everything is exactly the same as the ones I had at work. The package looks the same, they both say ""Heart Healthy Mix"" on them, except walnuts have been substituted instead of hazel nuts. Unfortunately, hazel nuts are my favorite.<br /><br />Otherwise, these are very good, just not as good (in my opinion) as if they had hazel nuts in them. So minus 1-star for Planters having two versions of the same thing without changing the name.<br /><br />What Amazon is selling (look at the picture of the box closely): Peanuts, Almonds, Pistachios, Pecans, & WALNUTS<br /><br />Also available, just not on Amazon: Peanuts, Almonds, Pistachios, Pecans, & HAZEL NUTS<br /><br />One other thing, the ""per ounce"" price that Amazon is showing is incorrect. This is a ""3-pack"" (3 separate boxes) of six 1.5 ounce pouches, so there are 18 X 1.5 ounce pouches total. This is a total of 27 ounces. Amazon is doing the calculation as if it is only 4 total ounces, so disregard Amazon's ""per ounce"" price."
1479,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
1480,"I hesitated to try this as, frankly, powdered peanut butter sounded repulsive.  However, since I was getting free shipping, I gave it a try.  At first taste, I thought it maybe needed a little more salt, but by my second taste, I was hooked on it, just as it is.  I like that I can add a tiny bit more water than it calls for and make it a little creamier, easier to spread.  I LOVE peanut butter, but almost always avoid it because of the fat and calories (even though I know ""it's a good fat"").  When you're counting calories, you just can't have 200 calories for 2T of peanut butter very often.  45 calories?  Done!  I love this stuff and don't think I will ever be without it in my pantry again."
1481,"Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.<br /><br />For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)<br /><br />Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.<br /><br />In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that."
1482,"Our dogs seem to have very broad tastes in dog food.  They were just as happy to eat this as their regular food, or any other dog food we've given them.  Given that this is almost certainly a bit pricier than what they normally get, this would have to be a special treat kind of thing for us.  It didn't seem to do anything special for them in terms of energy, coat, etc., but they really weren't on it long enough for a valid comparison.  If I had more money than human being should be allowed to have, this would certainly be a regular part of their diet, just because they seemed to like it so much."
1483,"absolutely love this coffee.  My son brought me this coffee from a visit to Costa Rica... I loved it, had to have more and was thrilled to find I could order it here!!! thanks!"
1484,"This drink is horrible the taste is just hard to swallow. I also think it makes me break out. I'm stuck with it now. So for the so called health benefits I'm going to try to consume one a week ,just to get rid of it. There is another flavor but, I really would like to sample before I order a case of 24 again. I have 20 left so I think I'll have to mix it with another flavored drink like crystal light or something like that.<br /><br />I hate to give a bad review but this one product deserved it. Sorry"
1485,"I purchased this product in hopes of finding a gluten free granola to replace the gluten variety I use to eat. It's not what I expected because I miss the oats, however it's great. I really enjoy the flavor, crunch and way it holds up in soy milk - something rare for a GF cereal.<br />It has also been a lifesaver on road trips where I couldn't find GF restaurants to stop at."
1486,"The flavor of the Wild Blueberry K-cups is refreshing and a nice change for coffee. I order this one regularly also.  If you like the flavor of blueberry, give this one a try. You'll get hooked."
1487,"There is an inherent problem with this tea bag style coffee. The bag traps air inside, and so it wants to float on top of the water, which means it doesn't really brew. You can stab at it with a fork, or weigh it down with a spoon, but this still just results in it sitting in the water. There's not water flowing threw it. So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother. I would not purchase this product."
1488,I bought this product for the fiber in prune juice to aid in my son's constipation. Compared to regular prune juice which has about 1.5 g fiber in 4 oz this juice has 0 g fiber in the same volume. The ingredients just list apple and prune juice but don't list how much of each. Clearly it's more apple than prune. If your kid likes to drink apple and prune juice then this product is fine but if you're looking for something to help with constipation you should look elsewhere.  What a waste.
1489,"These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?"
1490,"Browsing the dog food aisle of the pet store, you see all kinds of labels like ""hearty grains"" and ""delicious oatmeal"". But dogs are carnivores. They don't sit down to a bowl of oatmeal on a winter morning. They eat meat. Buy them a meat based diet, they will expel less waste, they'll be fuller for longer and this one is full of super healthy stuff so you don't have to add in yogurt for their coat or berries for their digestion."
1491,Worst product ever from Amazon..and i buy a lot of things but this tastes like dead fish that died twice.Do not buy.<br />Buy the dead fish instead.
1492,"I use to cut up green papaya the old fashion way, with a knife, and it took forever!  A friend told me about this and wow it makes the job 10X easier.  I havent used it for anything other than making Som Tum though.  Love it"
1493,"While the bag and the food inside look like a nutritious gourmet treat for your dogs, it is not quite what it seems.  My dogs all love this, but it is no better than any of the cheap dog foods with tons of soy products.  If you are looking for a better caliber dog food, this is not it.  It is better packaged, but it is junk food for your animals."
1494,"I like to use this flour instead of white rice flour because it's more nutritious. (Kind of like bleached flour vs. whole wheat.) It's a bit grainy, so be sure to mix other flours with it. Also, keep it in the fridge because brown rice flour goes bad quickly."
1495,"Our cat loves this formula.  I'm happy that the primary ingredients are actual meat, rather than grains.  Cats are carnivores, after all.  Our cat has had many less problems with hairballs and weight gain as well."
1496,"I started taking brewers yeast because the large amount of chromium in it is supposed to be very good for your skin, especially if it's acne prone. I've been taking it since the end of January and my skin still breaks out a little bit, but I stopped taking it for a couple of days and my face broke out a lot so I suppose that it is having some sort of an effect. An online review I read said that most people's skin cleared after eight months in an study, so I am staying positive.<br /><br />I started out by taking Swansons' Brewer's Yeast Powder, and mixed it in smoothies and grapefruit juice. I tried mixing it in orange juice, which was pretty bad, and even just having it with water, which was horrible and made me gag. Because I wasn't crazy about the taste, I read some reviews and decided to try this product next. The taste is much better, it is much less noticeable, especially if I add a little bit of peanut butter or grapefruit juice to the smoothies. The taste is also not at all noticeable in warmed apple juice. I don't have the courage to try it in plain water, though.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is that it does not dissolve well. I cannot stir it in any cold liquid without getting clumps (hopeless when stirred with a spoon or knife, somewhat works when stirred with a fork but little clumps remain), I can barely dissolve all of it in warmed liquids, and if I put it first in my blender when I make the smoothies, a lot of it remains at the bottom. In that respect, I liked Swansons' Brewer's Yeast better. This one is a little bit high maintenance because if I want to just have it in grapefruit juice, I have to put it in the blender first and when I make smoothies, I have to make sure that it's one of the last things to go in. I would, however, buy this product again if I can't find a brewers yeast that has the taste of this product with a better solubility."
1497,"I have been giving my cat Weruva for about a week after I received a free can from my local pet store. My cat absolutely loved it and ate it right up! So, I was pleased and decided to order more... without doing my research. I was very saddened when I learned that Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K)is used in their FISH (please note this ingredient is used only in fish) I do not understand why they are using this synthetic form of Vitamin K when they could easily substitute something real like KELP. Do your own research, especially on Menadione. I would also like to greatly note that a small ""made in Thailand"" is on the can and that also freaked me out. The product looks amazing, my cat loves it and I will finish off the cans I bought locally but will be returning this to Amazon. Come on, Weruva, I think you could do better than this. (By the way, Vitamin K is NEEDED for Fish diets in cats, but there are other ways to provide it in the canned foods.)"
1498,Our dog Lilly loves these treats! We only give her one when we leave the house.  She sits and waits for us to leave every morning so she can have her treat.
1499,This oil is incredible when it comes to conditioning and moisturizing. I use it on my 4b curly hair. I mix a little orange oil or lavender essential oil with it to kill the unpleasant smell. This keeps my hair from smelling funny and I am able to oil my scalp with it as well. Since I've been using it people tell me my hair looks thick and healthy.It's also a great at detangling my hair after a co-wash.
1500,Everyone in my family loves these. The are a cross between a twizzler and a fruit snack. They come individually wrapped so they are easy to take on the go or throw into lunches. There are 70 calories per package. Which isn't to bad since they are pretty chewy and fun to eat.  I would recommend these to friends and family. They are a treat you can feel good about eating.
1501,"You have to use a few of them, but they work.<br /><br />Don't forget the bicarb soda."
1502,"What can you say about granola? If you like granola, and you want it to be additive free, this is for you. Kind Blueberry clusters with Flax seeds has whole grains such as amaranth, quinoa, oats, milet and buckwheat. It also has apple, blueberry and plum puree that act like raisins,you get an occasional lump of one to add to the taste. There is no refined sugar since the cereal is sweetened with apple juice. To me it tastes like granola that is not too sweet and has a flax seed kick (watch out, they can get stuck in your teeth). The serving is 1/3 a cup (kind of skimpy if you ask me). Another reviewer mentioned it was too crunchy and sweet. Considering granola is crunchy, that shouldn't be a surprise and this is about as sweet as unsweetened applesauce. To me baklava is too sweet. This granola, not even even close.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown of the nutrient values.<br /><br />Calories 120<br />Fat 3g<br />Cholesterol 0mg<br />Sodium 20mg<br />Total Carb 22g<br />Fiber 5g<br />Sugars 5g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />You aren't going to get more ""No ____ Added"" than this. No gluten, no refined sugar, no GMO (whatever that is), no trans fat, no cholesterol, no dyes, no chemicals. The clusters are tasty and its got a nice amount of fiber. Here's to your health."
1503,"I was only provided with one single-serving (about a teaspoon of the mix) with which to review this product...not an easy task; I stopped by my local health food store to buy some additional product in order to be able to give better feedback. Doesn't taste fantastic, but is OK enough to accomplish hydration.<br />My overall impression is that it tastes like a fizzy G*torade...but a healthier version; actually, it is more like Alacer's Emergen-C products, which are available here on Amazon, as well, and can often be purchased at a less-expensive pricepoint.<br />The manufacturer's website states that EBOOST has:<br /><br />  * NO sugar<br />  * NO artificial colors<br />  * NO artificial flavors<br />  * NO high fructose corn syrup<br />  * NO crystalline fructose<br />  * NO soy<br />  * NO gluten<br />  * NO lactose<br /><br />The biggest concern is the overall cost...I would say it is worth a try if priced to be competitive with Alacer and other similar products."
1504,"I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me."
1505,"This item was a nice selection, but the shipping and handling for such a small item, mad it not worth the purchase.  Shipping and handling were $35.00 which I thought was ridiculous, I would not purchase from this store again."
1506,"I ordered this item, hoping that the combination of nuts would be good, but I was sadly disappointed with the taste.  Its like they tried to use as little sweetener as possible, leaving a dry, dull, bland taste and its like I could have just bought a bag of mixed nuts for cheaper than what I paid for this box of bars.<br /><br />Would not buy again."
1507,"After reading some mixed reviews, I decided not to get my hopes up too high for the chocolate pb2, so I didn't go into trying it expecting nutella or anything.  The consistency was a lot smoother than I expected, not as grainy as regular peanut butter, which I didn't mind.  It was nice and creamy and though it may not be as sweet as regular peanut butter, it was sweet enough for me to be happy to eat it alone with a spoon! haha.  I thought it was actually really good and can see myself keeping with this stuff for a long time."
1508,"My puppy loves these vitality treats. After reading the other two reviews I became concerned and quickly e-mailed the company with my concerns. Here is what they replied to me which immediately relieved my worries. They also sent me documentation of their checks on the products and pictures of the non-caged chickens.<br /><br />Hello Karen,<br /><br />Thank You for contacting us here at DOGSWELL®.<br /><br />The DOGSWELL® manufacturing facilities meet the highest and most strict sanitary conditions.

1509,"The pink color is very nice and bright. I made some candy hearts and they came beautifull. I also used it for cake pops but it have to be mixed with a little amount of paramount crystals to be liquid enough for coating the cake pops. It's liquids much better than Wilton's.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008DI8OY"">Paramount Crystals</a>"
1510,"Love this chai tea!  The balance of spices is just perfect and I love the extra hint of orange.  I put one regular-sized scoop of this chai tea in my glass teapot and don't even bother with the infuser, add hot water, and let steep for about 5 minutes - I can get about 3 large (12 oz) mugs of tea per scoop.  The flavor is very rich and robust and holds its own with honey and milk.  I have never found any chai tea-bags that can match the full flavor of this loose tea, and having it automatically delivered once a month on Amazon's Subscribe & Save program is soooo convenient."
1511,One of the tastiest and healthiest snacks I've ever seen.  These are so good that I've already ordered another case of them!
1512,"The laces we usually get around here are on the softer side, and are sweeter. These are more licorice tasting, and are tougher to chew. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was that they tasted exactly like a common red licorice candy.... I could ave gotten the flavor at the local convenience store.<br />But, I purchased them for my husband, and he loves them. He eats one every day- so they work for us."
1513,12 oz of cranberry and  buffalo...for $36...you do the math.<br /><br />Great taste from the sugar and fat...but unless your a fat cat...stay back!
1514,"After finding out I had a sensitivity to wheat, I searched for alternatives. I decided to try this mix and make some biscuits. Wow, were they good! They sort of reminded me of challah with a slight eggy flavor. They came out more like sandwich rolls (rather than flaky biscuits) but not quite as big. I'm thinking of making them super size next time so I can slice them in half and use for my lunches. After eating corn tortillas every day, I'm glad I found something else I can have. I also made an oven pancake with the mix and that was very good too. I highly recommend it."
1515,These are great for quick lunches at work. I do wish that they'd make a microwave bowl type but I guess that's raise the price too much.
1516,use to eat bon bons when I was a kid in high school and now no one even knows what they are. I love bon bons.
1517,"I purchased this product for my husband who loves very bold coffee.  Each time we have made the coffee in our Keurig it explodes all over.  (Clearly after the third try I have now thrown the rest away) We were lucky to always be away from the coffee maker, but if you were standing there it would have burned you.  All the other types off coffee that we have used and continue to use work perfectly, so I know that the Emeril coffee was the problem.  If you have kids keep them away from the coffee maker."
1518,"Terrible & expensive for what you get. Tiny little kernels, lots of hulls. Stick with the cheap store bought.<br />Bleh what a rip off."
1519,"I've been taking this for over a year before going to bed and have not had any problems going to sleep or staying asleep at night since I've started taking it.  According to the experts, it's one of the most important minerals for asthmatics to take because it relaxes the bronchial tube muscles hence either eliminating or reducing bronchial tightness/restriction.  Although my asthma has been asymptomatic for quite some time, the magnesium is good to use for so many other reasons and to maintain my health.  It's also a natural laxitive and helps prevent indigestion.  This is 100% natural elemental magnesium citrate so there is no need to worry about taking in any strange chemicals as you would when taking a synthetic vitamin supplement."
1520,"My husband loves these little licorice pastels.  We have only been able to find them as part of a mixture with other licorice pieces that are not his favorites.  For Christmas I did a search and found these packages of pastels by themselves.  I bought them for stocking stuffers, and my husband loves them.  This was one of my really successful surprises.  The candies are of high quality, and were shipping to me in a timely manner during the holidays, and arrived before Christmas."
1521,"I suffer from frequent yeast infections. This product was recommended to me to be applied as a cream for treatment. It cuts down itching, burning feeling you get with a yeast infection, makes it a lot more tolerable. Not a quick cure, but if used at the onset of the symptoms can help keep it to a minimum."
1522,"This is my favorite tea! I like tea all around, but jasmine green tea is what I am really attracted to. It's a bit hard to find in stores so I usually buy 2 at a time when i do. To save a little cash since i'm a big tea drinker I alternate with with Twinnings jasmine green tea. Though nothing can really compare to the perfect harmony of the flower and tea. It's just so delicious, not too overbearingly floral either. The only tea i've found that has come close is Migty Leaf's mountain spring jasmine. But Numi is a much better value."
1523,"I ordered these Clark Candy Bars as a birthday present for my husband. This is a candy he remembered from his childhood which was many years ago, and we can't find in the store anymore. Luckily I found them on Amazon and ordered them in time for his birthday. He loves them and each time he takes one out of the container I hear a ""yum yum"". They were in perfect condition when they arrived and I'll be ordering more when he finishes these.<br />[[ASIN:B004KNI8KM Clark Bar, 100 count tub)"
1524,"I lived in two places in Nepal for a total of three years and had two different cooks/ house helpers at different times that made chicken curry in their own way every Friday night with palou (spelling) which is a rice fried in ghee with cashews, coconut, etc. This is by far my favorite meal in the world! I was seeking out an easy way to make chicken curry even though it is really not that hard to do. I tried the Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Butter Chicken Curry and was blown away. It was just the right heat and I followed the directions exactly and added the recommended amount of water. I always like to try it first according to manufacturer's directions and thought the thickness of the sauce was perfect and the salt wasn't overpowering but we may add a little more water next time. I definitely recommend to not forget the fresh cilantro at the end. It really brings everything together for that authentic taste! Everyone loved it including those that weren't accustomed to spicy food. They still tolerated the spiciness just fine even though it does bring on the sweat! My husband snuck in the kitchen the next day and ate all of the leftovers! He also requested this meal for his birthday. This tastes so close to what I ate in Nepal at my home there and in the local hole in the wall restaurants so it is a very pleasant reminder of my time there. It is delicious and I'm looking forward to eating it again!"
1525,"I don't usually like really crispy cookies, but the taste of these changed my mind.  I like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories.  I often go for ""quantity"" over ""quality"" so I would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie."
1526,"I found this to be a very smooth and somewhat rich coffee.  Very enjoyable with good flavor, but not with a lot of depth or darkness.  Ethiopia has produced some of the best coffee in the world, and while this may not be the best I have ever tasted, it is a very good medium roast, full flavored coffee without a lot of bitterness.  This is the best cup of pod coffee I have tasted so far.<br /><br />In addition to the pod brewer, I also tried this coffee pod in a pour-through basket with boiling water and also steeping it like a cup of tea and found that the flavor was pretty consistent, if not better when brewed outside of the pod brewer (I was able to steep the coffee much stronger and to higher yield in a cup with boiling water -but slower than the pod brewer).  The pods are marked with which side up/down and should be tucked down tight in the pod brewer for the best results.  Each pod is individually wrapped airtight, and tasted as fresh as any other pre-ground or pod coffee I have tried.  Sustainably grown."
1527,"This cereal is nothing special among American breakfast cereals. It is quite sweet, very crunchy and seems more of a dessert topping than an actual healthy way to start your day.If you want to begin your day with a lot of crunchy and highly-sugared dry cereal...this is the product for you.But- do not expect this to be an item that will be healthy and provide well for you nutritionally."
1528,"My dogs cannot get enough of these Jumbones. My Great Dane is not excitable about anything...EXCEPT Jumbones. She is usually reserved and holds back until my Lab gets whatever treat we are handing out. But, when it comes to Jumbones, she knocks the Lab right out of the way and follows me around the house with her nose in the air and a look that says, ""GIMME GIMME GIMME GIMME!!"""
1529,"I should start this off by saying that prior to trying this mix, I have NEVER liked bloody marys. Every time I tried one, I would be disappointed, and grossed out. Now that being said, this mix blew my mind! It is the best bloody mary I've ever had, and I love love LOVE it! Definitely worth the money as it is concentrated, and delicious with some lime flavored soda water added. MMMMmmMMMMMM.. I'm having one right now! :)"
1530,"I am addicted to this juice. The pineapple orange apple is so delicious!!  Also, my 21 month old can easily drink the juice through a straw. The containers are the perfect size for his little hands!"
1531,"Xylitol looks and acts so much more like real sugar than other<br />alternative sweeteners. It doesn't have an aftertaste, it dissolves<br />completely, and it measures like sugar. I also like the fact<br />that a sweetener can be good for your dental health. I chose Emerald<br />Forest because it is made in America (not China) and it is<br />natural. I will definitely continue to buy this product."
1532,"I prefer flavored coffees and this one and the pumpkin spice are my absolute favorites. The chocolate and raspberry go so well with the coffee that it's like drinking dessert. Love it! And SO glad it's available on subscription. Thanks, Amazon."
1533,"I love the Jack Link products, but this a bit on the dry side and not much of a BBQ taste."
1534,"Even though these are in sealed, individual packages, which is nice, it seems like they don't retain there freshness.  A few of the sticks got like shoe leather and had little taste.  I would not purchase them again.  I think they should have more flavor since they are vaccummed sealed for freshness.  Also the sticks get very hard."
1535,"Just the right combination of cereal, clusters, and dried peaches that come to life with milk.  My whole family really likes it.  Too expensive to have all the time though, and not available locally."
1536,"My dog Annie has a health condition by the name of Megaesophagus,  anyone interested in learning about this can find information on the internet.  We had got to the point where we did not know what to feed her.<br /><br />Her regular dog food would get incapsulated in the slime, and she would vomit it all up including the slime. This food is high in protein and calories I add enough water to it and mix it well to where it passes through to her stomach.<br /><br />She has two meals a day  and thanks to finding this food I did not have to put her to sleep.  (Her condition had got that bad)"
1537,My wife has a glass each and every day.This is the best k cup iced coffee we have tried.She likes to chill it in the fridge for a bit after brewing.Very Good!
1538,I've tried all brands and this one always comes out nicely moist and flavorful!  Mahatma is definitely far better than most other brands in all their rice selections.
1539,"I prefer the ""extra bold"" coffees, so this one really lacking on the flavor.  It's fairly weak, at the smallest cup setting its drinkable, but I won't be buying it again.  I'd recommend the Timothy's World Coffee, Rainforest Decaf Espresso instead."
1540,"I cannot abide plain coffee so I've been sampling all the flavored coffees for our new Keurig machine. Some have just been too strong for me, too bitter, or too chemically tasting. (Husband calls me Coffee goldilocks) So I was delighted to realize the Folgers Caramel Drizzle was just right. Sort of a smooth, silky feel in the mouth, mild to medium roast and not too strong at all. The caramel flavor is light and not overwhelming, but it smells GREAT while brewing. It's not quite sweet enough for me (that being said, it IS lightly sweet on it's own). I added a teaspoon of sugar to a 7 ounce cup and literally a splash of milk and it was perfect. Fortunately this is also available regularly at our local grocery store as well as Amazon. And for less than the third party sellers are offering it."
1541,"Back to buy more.  Love this tea!  I have had a lot of different green tea, jasmine green tea is my favorite, and this is my favorite jasmine green tea of any that I've tried.  Great quality and flavor!  LOVVVVE IT!"
1542,"As with all foods, your mileage may vary with this product depending on freshness and all that. I didn't much care for it at first, but I found it to be an acquired taste and I actually do like the product now.<br /><br />It can be a bit greasy, but word has it that if you let greasy 'jerky' products sit out overnight in the open air that it helps with that. I've never had an issue with it, so I don't know for sure, but I suppose it'd be worth a try if you like the taste but find it a bit oily.<br /><br />All in all, compared with some of the gross real-meat jerky products I've tried, this stuff is pretty good. But don't take my word for it, try it out for yourself."
1543,"I started buying Avoderm for a cat with a skin problem. She kept licking the fur off her tummy. Nothing worked - even those high-powered pricey foods from the vet.<br /><br />Then we discovered Avoderm and now it's my primary food of choice for all three of my companion animals. My dog (the CanineUrbanPrincess) had minor skin issues when I adopted her. She kept scratching. After I switched her food to Avoderm (mixed with some California Natural), she seemed better. Her coat is shiny.<br /><br />Best of all, Gracie is a dog who eats everything in sight. ""Garbage gastritis"" is no joke to us. Avoderm (at least the chicken version) goes easy on her tummy."
1544,It was very tasty and soft. It was a little dry for me but my 7 year old loved it. I have a glass of milk with the cookie and it is a nice treat.
1545,"i was expecting a, packaged,  Tea Sampler package from ""k-Cup"".. not a bunch of single,random k-cups throw into an amazon box. some of the k-cups were damaged and already had holes in them. this is not what i was expecting at all."
1546,"A slightly bitter aftertaste does not make these one of the better (easier to consume) gu flavors, but I attribute it to the caffeine which frankly is well worth it on long runs."
1547,"I am not a huge soda drinker but when I want soda I want a Coke! That's bad in my case because I'm fat! About 6 weeks ago I decided to try the Atkins diet. The Atkins diet is a lower carb diet so I had to give up sweets and sugary drinks. I needed a replacement for my occasional Cokes. I tried regular diet Coke but found that it had an after taste. A friend suggested Coke Zero.<br /><br />I love it! The taste is very similar to regular Coke (not exact) but a very satisfying alternative.<br /><br />Overall, if your looking for a GOOD tasting diet soda I don't think you can do better than Coke Zero."
1548,"I have tried many different types of protein drinks, and this is certainly the best one out there.  It has the best taste and the best list of ingredients.  They should bring back the Amazon Subscribe and Save option for this product."
1549,"I use a combination of Pennery's New Mexico and Gebhardt's in my chili. I think the combination produces a very smooth Chili.  Remember to add 1TBS more of both about 30 minutes before it is done to retain the real chili powder ""bite"" that is so good."
1550,The flavors in this pack are delicious and taste exactly like the jar describes.  My girls love that they can really taste the differences in each flavor when creating a cotton candy of different colors.
1551,"This was an impulse buy. I purchased other food items and decided to try getting this from Amazon. I later found that the same product was much cheaper at my local Big Box Membership Warehouse store. The jerky was about the same freshness as I find in local stores. I was hoping for fresher, ie softer jerky."
1552,"This is the best marinade to inject in a Fried Turkey EVER made!  You don't have to add anything of your own (maybe a little olive oil, but that's all).  Plus there is a shaker mix you can buy to sprinkle on the top of the turkey, BUT this marinade can be injected to make a tender, juicy fried turkey.  We LOVED it!"
1553,This is a great product. I send it to my mother-in-law so that she stays regular. She has had medical issues for quite some time and could never find anything that would work on a continuous basis. This does the trick.
1554,I first tried this last year at starbucks. Now I am hooked. I really love this milk and I think its the best milk I ever had.
1555,"As a special treat, a pig ear is easily one of the best choices for man's best friend. My little friend loves these and won't let them go until the last bit is done.<br /><br />Unlike some other chew treats, there aren't any parts of this which are hard to eat so you won't have any little scraps left over. No muss, no fuss and a happy dog is what you want and what you get.<br /><br />I don't know first-hand how these taste but the pooch sure does want more!"
1556,My son loves the Andy Capp hot fries but they are way too hot for me.  I like these. They have such a good flavor and texture. Warning: they are addictive!
1557,"I did not realize until I received this product, that it contains propylene glycol. To be fair to the seller, if you read down the amazon page far enough, that fact is stated.  However, I find the thought of ingesting propylene glycol disgusting, so I am going to search for a replacement that is pure natural lavender."
1558,"Honestly, I'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  It's a little weak but mostly just doesn't have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and Folger's Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee."
1559,"What a great idea for a treat.  Lickety Stik is constructed like a roll-on deodorant with a flavored dog treat inside.  Hold the Stik upside down and my dog licked away at it.  It is low calorie (great for my dog who is on a diet). It is also very easy to carry.  I keep it in my pocket.Since it has a cap and has plastic construction, it doesnt get crushed in my pocket. It makes a great little reward during training sessions.<br /><br />I find it especially helpful to reward my dog when Im teaching him a new trick. With the lickey stik he was very eager to see the stik come out.<br /><br />A few notes on the Lickety Stik's use.  The first time you use the Lickety stik, you may have to move the roller-ball with your fingers to get the treat to flow a little.  Once the dog understands that licking the ball makes the treat flow, it is not an issue. Also when he is done licking, there is no dripping.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik also has a clear window at the base of of the bottle so you know when it is time to reorder.<br /><br />The Lickety Stik is not large which makes it easy to trasport. However it does mean that if it is your primary treat for you dog, you may run out quickly.<br /><br />Overall, I can say that the dog was enthusiastic about the stick. It was easy to use. It was fun to give. I am happy with this product."
1560,A waste of my money. Extremely weak; even if I do 2 K cups at a 4 oz cup. No flavor. What I ended upd doing was to purchase Extra Bold K Cups and use Stevia Clear Hazelnut drops.
1561,"This is some of the best oatmeal I've ever had. Keep in mind that it takes over 30 minutes to cook (several hours in a slow-cooker) but it also holds very well for days in the refrigerator. Therefore, we always make at least triple batches and continue to heat them up in the microwave for the next few days. It is great reheated with frozen blueberries added to it. Mmmmmm<br /><br />If you've read that oatmeal can be healthy and a good way to reduce your cholesterol they aren't talking about instant oatmeal. Instant and quick (minute) oatmeal can be cooked quickly because it isn't the whole oats which are needed to get the health benefits. These steel cut oats have Dietary Fiber 4g made up of Soluble Fiber 2g and Insoluble Fiber 2g while <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1LI4"">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Variety Pack, 14.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> has Dietary Fiber 3g made up of Soluble Fiber 1g and Insoluble Fiber 0g."
1562,"Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Kona Blend, Whole Bean Coffee, I am addicted to it !!!  I buy it every time it even gets close to running out.  The folks at Jeremiah's Pick are very prompt and every order is right on time or early. Everyone has their own taste but as far as I am concerned , this is the best coffee I have ever drank !!!"
1563,"What on Earth am I missing here? Almost 6 bucks a box? for a regular size? WHAT? If anyone can help me figure out why they are charging over $23 for 4 boxes of Cheerios, let me know. I must be misunderstanding something here."
1564,I am a bit torn on these Popchips Tortilla style. I really liked the original Popchips with the different flavors and textures but the tortilla do not seem a good replacement for real tortilla chips and the flavors seem a little too light and washed out. After all real tortilla chips with real salsa is great and better for you too... bean dip not as good and cheese might be the worst (health wise not taste).
1565,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, potatoes, salmon oil, flax seed, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it."
1566,"Followed the directions by letting the machine ""warm up"" then we only used flossing sugar (we bought online via Amazon for $19.95 for 3 flavors) in the machine and we instantly  had cotton candy forming. It made a decent amount for a serving. I noticed the sugar builds up quickly and after 3 sticks of cotton candy we had to wash the middle piece that holds the candy/sugar or else it was not going to work properly. The only negative thing my family noticed is there seem sot be ""cotton"" floating in the air while the machine is running. I did not notice it being right next to the machine but they were in the dinning room and could see the candy floating in tiny pieces through the house. Smells good & taste awesome. We did not attempt to use the hard candy. Only the flossing sugar."
1567,"I have tried herbal coffee before, and never could see the appeal, but I decided to try once again, and happened to pick up Maya Caffe.  What a pleasant surprise!  It has the richness of coffee, and a energy kick, without caffiene.  I was much surprised and pleased.<br /><br />It may not replace Starbucks, but if you want to kick caffiene, or even just looking for a warm rich beverage that's suitable for evening, I'd recommend this product highly!"
1568,"I thought, its ready-to-eat chicken. I thought to put in oven, heat and eat.<br />But what they sent in the pack is just some rice(raw rice, need to cook), chicken masala powder/paste.<br />The description is not written correctly.<br />Its not worth to buy raw rice and masala with this price."
1569,Even factoring in shipping cost this is a great deal on a great product.  It's also the 3rd time I've ordered it. The quality and service can't be beat!
1570,"Zico in the tetra pak is my favorite coconut water, and the passion fruit is my favorite flavor.  Coconut water isn't for everyone, it is a very faint, mild taste, but it is very pleasant and refreshing, especially during or right after a workout.  I have tried pretty much every flavor of every brand, and Zico in the tetra pak is the best, doesn't have the weird aftertaste that some of the other brands do.  I like mango and plain OK too, but the passion fruit is my favorite.  Coconut water is not for those who are used to strong, very sweet drinks, but if you're looking for a healthier, better tasting water this might be for you.  And though it's out of stock now, Zico says it will be back in distribution later in summer 2010.  I can't wait!"
1571,Very pleased with this healthy and affordable dog food. My greyhound loves it and his stools are smaller and firm on this kibble. Absolutely no problems with gas or loose stools during the transition to this kibble or after.
1572,I was a little weary about buying 5 packs of raisins at once for fear that they may be dry and hard and I would hate them. That was not the case at all!! I am so glad I went ahead and ordered and subscribed for set deliveries. These are plump and moist and sweet- everything you could want in a raisin!! They are fantastic and have become one of my favorite snacks.
1573,These lollipops taste just like regular lollipops but are sweetened without refined sugar.  My son and I love them.  And they are made on equipment free of the top 8 USA food allergens.  I'm very glad to have found these and recommend them to others avoiding refined sugar or allergens.
1574,"The Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula is a good product. As our pediatrician had told us, there is no significant difference amongst the infant formulas. When our pediatrician's kids were infants, they would get whatever formula was the least expensive. While Earth's Best is not the cheapest, it is priced competitively, and most importantly is conveniently delivered to our door. No complaints from our daughter. :-)"
1575,"Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another  product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this."
1576,"I had heard about this product in a class I had attended and found it at one local grocery store.  I checked Amazon and found the 1 lb bag at a much better price than the grocery store jar.  We use it when we travel and at home.  You honestly cannot tell the difference in it and a jar of processed peanut butter. You mix it fresh, when you need it and have none of the added sugars, salt and whatever else the manufacturers might add.  Far less fat, too.  It is a wonderful product.  I just ordered my second bag of PB2!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P4POZ8"">Powdered Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 16 Oz</a>"
1577,"I take one every morning with breakfast. I get a little energy burst without that jittery feeling from too much caffeine. With all the benefits Green Tea has to offer, this is a staple in my home."
1578,"The ham was awesome and the service was prompt and courteous, I would do business again with Omaha Steaks."
1579,"I have an elderly dog with hip and joint problems. She has been taking Zuke's Hip Action Dog treats for a little more than a month and there has been a HUGE difference in her. She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday broke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!"
1580,"I love Watermelon! At work one day, a friend offered me a Dunkin Donuts Watermelon coolatta. I didnt think I would care for a slush drink - but it was fantastic and soon, I was buying one every day. I have a home snow cone and slushy maker, so I went in search of a good Watermelon Syrup.<br /><br />I tried Monin, Torani, DaVinci, and Best Bargain brands Watermelon syrup. Let me warn you so you dont waste your money like I did - DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS. #1, not even one of these products contains ANY Watermelon. They are all basically the same with Sugar, Lemon juice, Melon flavoring (NOT Watermelon), and red dye. NOT one single bit of Watermelon in any of them. #2, They dont taste even remotely like Watermelon, and in fact all but Best Bargain have disgusting taste to them. I tried various quantities of the syrup from very little to a lot - and either way, they taste horrible! #3, you can EASILY make your own delicious Watermelon syrup. There are a number of recipies on the web. Some require rendering (boiling down) but you dont have to use those to get a very good homemade, TRUE tasting syrup.<br /><br />Avoid these products like the plague!!!<br /><br />Note - Dunkin Donuts does not seem to sell their syrup, however you can go to their web site and click the ""Contact Us"" button and send them a note that you would like to purchase their syrup (if you like it - and it is the best) and if you have a local shop, you can ask the manager if he/she wouldnt mind buying an extra one for you!<br /><br />Otherwise, make your own! Its the only way to get good taste. However, these products, Monin, Torani, DaVinci and Best Bargain are horrible and while they look like transmission fluid - I will wager THAT tastes better!"
1581,I had read a lot about the health benefits of using Canidae for my dogs.  I think I have seen evidence of healthier skin in my dog with skin issues.
1582,"The Belly Flops were awesome!  I put them in smaller bags and gave them away as fun stocking stuffers for the family.  Everyone loved them, and it became a fun game to guess all of the flavors as there is no map to tell you."
1583,"I had heard commercial fondants tasted bad but this actually tastes very good. It has a nice buttery vanilla flavor. I haven't rolled it out to cover a cake yet. What I used if for so far was to make cute little accessories for a gingerbread house I donated to a charity event. I colored it and rolled out square yellow windows and green awnings plus a chocolate brown front door. Also added some tylose powder to make gumpaste figures such as a light fixture with a yellow gumdrop ""light bulb"" and a little mouse for my pretzel woodpile. This fondant worked very well for my purpose and everyone liked my finished gingerbread house. Next I will be using it to roll out and cut out little fondant Christmas decorations for cupcakes. Having already worked with it I'm sure this fondant will work out perfectly."
1584,"I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats . Unfortunetly , I cannot write a review because none of the cats would eat it . This is also true of the turkey and salmon flavor I purchased at the same time . Guess they just don't have a yen for a higher end cat food ! Sorry"
1585,Exactly as described by the seller. This plant arrived on time and alive and well. Note the size of the plant to make sure it is what you want. It is a wonderful addition to the decor. More money for the years to come! :D
1586,"I read the reviews and ordered...skeptically. Could it really be that good?  I have Stevia in my coffee 6 days of the week and treat myself to sugar on Sundays.  Could I again enjoy a cola, that tastes like a real cola?  YES....PEOPLE...YOU CAN!  I am addicted to these and just ordered the cherry cream!  Zero calories and yummy.  SOLD."
1587,"Everyone in my family loves these delicious real food gummies. Annies has went above and beyond with the creation of this delicious flavor. My grandkids ages 1 to 5 and my kids 9 and 12 ask for these constantly. They love them so much, that I have to get me a pack when I first open a box ,or I will not get any.  All the Annie gummy bunies are great."
1588,"I liked the smell and mix, it was a bit bitter in taste, but got better when I used less tea for the same amount of water"
1589,"Canela is Spanish for ""cinnamon""-so this new Starbucks natural fusions coffee has a hint of Brazil. It evokes Ana Rita Simonka's song about a Bengal woman with cinnamon (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00042Y5XC"">Bossa Nova Delhi</a>) Cinnamon is commonly used to flavor coffee in South America. Starbucks' taste is alright, the cinnamon isn't that strong. It's not a terrible coffee, but it's not that great either. The cinnamon is subtle to the point of non-existence. Starbucks' Cinnamon Coffee is best accompanied with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B4GFNO"">Brazilian Cafe</a>,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00075147Q"">Acoustic Brazil</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000IWNN"">Brasileiro</a>. There's a hint of the exotic. It's okay."
1590,I am a Starbucks loyalist but Cafe Bomrad Torino blows Starbucks away.  Excellent full bodied taste and smell but no bitterness. Great either black or with steamed milk.  A terrific daily treat for coffee enthusiasts.  I highly recommend you give it a try!
1591,Maybe I put it on the wrong thing but I did not like it at all. It gave my porkchops a strange taste. I used it twice and I am scared to use it again. Don't want to ruin anymore food.
1592,"My mother-in-law recommended this tea to me to help me naturally alleviate my menstrual cramps. I have to warn that the tea doesn't ""kick in"" for a couple of cycles, so don't drink this expecting a magic cure-all within the first cup. I used to be very dependent on Advil, Tylenol, etc. so this tea was a lifesaver.<br /><br />It's a very mild tea and you don't need a lot of sugar or honey in it. I recommend it."
1593,"I've seen other reviewers say their cats wouldn't eat the vegetables in Spot's Stew. Before deciding for or against this product, try just a couple of flavors from Petco or Petsmart first. My cat goes ga-ga for all of this product, including the vegetables. Every cat's different. I know this product is healthy from looking at the label. I used to buy Blue, but one of the top Blue ingredients is chicken meal, which, if you look that up on the internet, is chicken skin. Uggh! I wouldn't ever want my furry loved one to eat skin - that's like feeding a human infant McDonald's, no offense to McD's."
1594,"I purchased this as a calcium-magnesium supplement for my kids.  This particular bottle does NOT have calcium as the picture of the nutrition label states.  That label belongs to a different product.  This is 325mg Magnesium citrate only, and it is Really tart!!  Now I am going to have to buy (and get the kids to take) a separate calcium supplement.:("
1595,This is the best dog treat for the best price.  Totally pleased with the whole shopping experience through Amazon.
1596,"This popcorn is perfectly seasoned and uses oil with butter flavor.  And it's convenient, self-contained in a sealed package.  Just open it and dump it into the popcorn maker.  Ever since I discovered this popcorn, I have not reverted to the old boring popcorn."
1597,Both my cats love this Avoderm food but when one started gaining too much weight I switched them to the weight control formula and they still seem to love it.  The older one has less hairballs and the younger one has lost a little weight too.
1598,"I didn't want to give a negative review because the taste of these lasagna noodles is wonderful but I didn't receive a reply from either amazon.com or the company itself when I sent them emails with my concerns. They sent me a box that was obviously damaged before it left amazon.com's packing place. A partially crushed box was inside a larger box that had no damage and included another product I ordered. It could have been blamed on the UPS, however a large part of the flap on top was completely torn off and not in the box so they knew it was broken before they sent it."
1599,These Pork Chomps seem much easier for my 10-month-old beagles to chew than regular rawhide.  They both get very excited when they see me with the bag!  I like the fact that they seem just the right saw to hold in their paws and there is never anything left when they are done chewing!
1600,"Kellogg's Frosted Rice Krispies Cereal is absolutely scrumptious! Sure, it's all in the sugar (smile); but once in a while you can give yourself a treat. It may be a better alternative to nothing for antsy kids who really didn't want any breakfast before school. As long as you eat these before the expiration date stamped on the box they will be delicious!<br /><br />The cereal is indeed fat and cholesterol free. That's great. The cereal contains no trans-fats--that's even better! There are 27 grams of carbs in each serving; so please be careful of that although on the other hand it's only about 9% of your daily limit for carbs as suggested by the government. Each serving of this cereal also has 25% of your recommended daily intake of Iron, Niacin, and Vitamins B12 and B6.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as you probably guessed by now, there's a price to be paid for all this. The cereal has sugar--18 grams of it when served in milk! If sugar is a dietary issue for you, consult your doctor before eating any of this cereal. There is no calcium at all in this cereal; and that's a disappointment. Sigh.<br /><br />After all is said and done, this cereal tastes great and it's a pleasure to eat--especially in the morning when you may want a pleasant, sweet start to a tough day ahead. However, the dietary issues do cause some concern; and I will take off one and ½ stars for this issue. Of course, life still is rather short however you slice it--so get a box today and treat yourself now and then! You'll enjoy it!"
1601,I love the sweet taste of this vinegar and it is great for portion control. No more soggy salads with too much dressing!
1602,"I received a Quaker Soft Baked Banana Bread Bar as part of my Influenster Summer Beauty Vox Box. I'm staunchly anti-banana, but this little treat sounded right up my mum's alley, so I had her eat it. This is what she thought. Keep in mind, Mum is already a big Quaker fan, and an even bigger fan of banana nut bread. She had Quaker oats for breakfast this morning actually. As prompted by the directions, she microwaved it for 10 seconds. She liked the packaging, since you could see the product, it had a full ingredient list, and plenty of nutritional information. The bar is 1.48oz (42g).Mum's initial thoughts were that the bar seemed to have decent nutritional value, and would make a convenient lunch time/after work snack. When she took her first bite, she seemed really impressed that it tasted ""like real banana nut bread!"", and said it had a crunchy but chewy texture with lots of almonds. She said the banana and nut flavors were well balanced.  She really liked it, she ate it super fast (she always yells at me about eating too fast ;_;). She saved tiny morsels of it for both our dogs, who agreed it was delicious.Overall, Mum really liked this Quaker bar. She said she'll probably buy a box of them next time she goes to the grocery store (provided she can find a coupon). She thinks full price ($3.30 MSRP for 6 bars) is reasonable, but like me, she kinda loves saving money. Her only complaint about Quaker's Soft Baked Banana Nut Bread Bar is that it contains corn syrup, aside from that, it was a hit. She gave it a 4/5."
1603,"All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)"
1604,exactly how I remembered it when living in England.  A taste of home.  Will probably re order later in the year.
1605,"First time I've ever cooked and eaten real oatmeal.  I was expecting it to be the same old same old; not at all!  Great texture and flavor.  Had it for breakfast and as snacks, too!  Made a big pot of it on Sunday, so I could eat it for breakfast all week: Yeah, right!  It was gone by Tuesday morning."
1606,"My daughter picked up a couple packages at Wal-Mart. We loved it and had to buy the big container. This stuff is really good, but I add a bit more powder than the dirctions call for."
1607,"I was recently gifted my first bottle of the Pepper Plant Original CA style hot sauce. Good garlicy/chili nose when opening the bottle. The chili flavor is very present (2-star heat), followed by the garlic. Balanced ""heat"" & flavors. Not too vinegary or salty. It reminds me of a ""Southwest Sriracha"". Makes a good everyday table sauce."
1608,"This is a tasty bar, but as it contains chocolate it isn't great for all occasions, like a breakfast snack, and to me isn't chocolatey enough to satisfy those type of dessert cravings.<br />It's still WAY better than other healthy chocolate fruit/nut bars."
1609,"Really refreshing and different!  A small bit goes a long way! I mix with seltzer to make a refreshing sparkling drink that's better than sweetened soft drinks! I am tired of how everything in America is made super sour with more and more citric acid, but this syrup is very naturally pomegranate-tasting with balanced sweetness and tartness. Fantastic!"
1610,Gevalia  Morning Roast Large is a pretty good buy for the the Tassimo single cup. It gives you a good large cup of coffee and also the free shipping was a benefit as well as pretty fast shipping and delivery.
1611,"I finally finished my box of the Blueberry Green Tea Powder and wanted to try something new!  So glad I tried this flavor as it is now my favorite!  Just add it to a cold bottle of water, drink it as is, or add a few drops of Stevia or Agave and you are good to go.  Very refreshing!!  Will be packing this on my trip to Mexico!"
1612,It is the perfect size portion pack for my new popcorn popper.<br />Tastes just like movie theater popcorn. I would recommend this<br />anyone that likes popcorn.
1613,"My late wife used this mix and made awesome cole slaw with it.  When our grocery store did not carry it and she tried another brand, we were disappointed, so I ordered a box of packs from Amazon.com.  Since my wife passed, I have made it twice myself for neighbors and all I can say is that there were no leftovers.  My only update to the instructions is to use less mayonnaise, but that is a personal taste choice."
1614,"These chips are awesome, simply awesome! I purchased a 24pk order of popchips from amazon a few months ago (Original flavour) and I absolutely fell in love!!! It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same ""crunch"" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D... POPCHIPS ROCK and are a part of my daily 3pm snack routine :D"
1615,"Good stuff....but.  I'd gotten some at Walmart but didn't really pay attention to the price (for one bag).  I enjoyed it so much that I searched for it on Amazon (in bulk) and ordered three different flavors.  I happened to be in Walmart the next morning and discovered to my surprise that it was significantly cheaper there.  (Walmart $3.50 for a 3.5oz bag, Amazon about $23.00 for ten 1.5oz bags - almost 50 cents an ounce more from Amazon plus you have to purchase it in bulk).  I find that I tend to order blindly from Amazon when I'm actually purchasing from Amazon and not a third-party vendor because I'm so used to fantastic savings.  This was a bit of a wake-up call.  I will give kudos to Amazon for their customer service policies, though.  I was able to cancel my order relatively hassle free."
1616,"I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises. I also have had problems with constipation for most of my life ( I'm sure it's because of my terrible diet which includes lots of sugar) and it also totally solved that problem. I would like you to know that I own no stock in the company, I do not know anyone in the company,I do not sell this product, and I do not have a dog in the fight however I would hate to think that I could no longer be able to get this product. After using several different types of magnesium I proclaim this to be the very best with no one in close 2nd place. I will tell you it takes a small amount of effort to figure out how much your body needs, I usually take about a teaspoonfull a day mixed in a bottle of plain water and I drink it though out the day and I do this about 3 times a day. This product has litterally changed my life and I think I could write a small book about it. I've told numerous people about it and it's a shame there are so many scams in the world that we as a people are so sceptical and that when a great product comes along we sometimes ignore it.."
1617,"Wow, I have to say, I did not enjoy this drink additive at all.  I've tried several other brands, some I liked some I didn't, but this was my first opportunity to enjoy a MIO, and it didn't speak well for the brand.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this product would probably be the taste.  It's supposed to be mango peach and honestly it didn't taste like either of those things.  The suggested serving is 1 squeeze per 8oz serving so I tried that at first in my water bottle.  It tasted like extremely watered down indeterminate flavored gatorade.  Not so good.  So the next time I amped it up and did 3-4 squeezes into my water bottle.  This time the flavor was stronger but it still didn't taste a thing like mango or peach and actually I felt like I was drinking that sugar water they place in hummingbird feeders.  The color was about the same too come to think of it.  It was kind of disappointing not only for the taste, but for the fact that I needed to use 3x the amount suggested to actually taste anything.  This means there probably won't be the 24 servings it says it has.  Not that I'll probably finish it.<br /><br />The only thing this had going for it was that the ingredients were somewhat natural.  But then they through a bunch of red and yellow dyes to bring that down.  It also has an attractive bottle that it comes in, easy to tote around.  But that only goes so far.  This product is supposed to flavor water and since it fails in that area I can't really recommend it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011"
1618,I get these on the subscribe and save program. My kids and I love these crackers.  They are great to have on hand and you can't beat the price. I am paying $7.62 for 2 12 count boxes right now.  I can't even get that price at the store when they are on sale.  Great deal!
1619,"This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite ""deal"" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google ""Doctor Cyberman innards"" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are."
1620,"A friend recently introduced me to coconut water and it was a hard sell - In general, I don't like coconut at all.  While I was skeptical, I agreed to at least give it a try.  I first tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC"">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a> and found that it was pretty okay, if I drank it over ice.<br /><br />Then I started reading more about the hydrating benefits of coconut water as well as the similarity to components in breast milk.  Being pregnant just this moment, I decided any boost to my eventual milk production would be welcome.  So I tried this product and liked the flavor MUCH better than plain coconut water.  I highly recommend it to anyone as a healthful beverage and particularly to those women who are, like me, ""in the family way."""
1621,"I gave them a 4 rating for being yummy, crispy and different.  I won't buy again because they were way too greasy and salty.  I thought I read it wrong when I glanced at the nutritional value while holding the bag with intensely greasy fingers after eating them.  Not fried?  All that grease doesn't make sense.  Anyway, was fun to try."
1622,"I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!"
1623,I've got 2 dogs and they love this food.  I also like when I order this dog food they ship it free to my house.
1624,"I love these snacks because they are whole grain and organic. I also love the fact that they do not spill everywhere out of the snack cup like cheerios. I have also noticed that they do not leave a lot of crumbs, which makes Mommy happy."
1625,"I'm a big time foodie.  This is by far the best tasting blue cheese, period.  A perfect balance of sweet and sour, with a beautifully balanced finish.  This is as good as it gets."
1626,"These are the best tasting tortilla chips I have ever had!  I have become allergic to tomatoes, but I love tortilla chips.  There is so much flavor in these chips that I no longer miss pico de gallo. I prefer to eat them plain. They also have just the right amount of heat to make them flovorful, but not overpoweringly spicy."
1627,If you like Peppermint then you will love this tea. It is another one of Celestial Seasoning superb products. Very warming and relaxing!
1628,"This food is not a good food and is not worth the money.  It contains by products and lots of corn.  It will make your cats fat and lazy.  My friend's cat was vomiting and had been to every vet and had every test but when she switched the food to Innova Evo, the cat stopped vomiting.  Do not buy this food because for the same price you can buy Evo which is grain free and made with table-grade meat. SCIENCE DIET IS GARBAGE!"
1629,"Over the past 6 months I've opened two cans that had pieces of fatty chicken, something I have never previously experienced in decades of using Campbell's soup. I've endured the characteristic mushy noodles for decades because I like this soup's flavor, but the fatty chicken is just too much.  I've stopped buying this product."
1630,"I was really exited to try this and very disappointed when I did. If you're looking for a substitute for Coke you won't find it here with this sickeningly sweet concoction. It might be a halfway decent replacement for Diet Coke or Pepsi as both of those are sweeter than Coke. On the other hand, the watered down nature of the ""cola"" flavor and the speed at which it loses carbonation probably eliminate it from contention for those as well. Very glad I only bought a 6 pack."
1631,love this Rodeo Drive it has a very drinkable taste is also good and it is smooth! I recomend that you try this one.
1632,"I like to add flax to my home-made breads, and this product is just what I wanted.  It's organic, packed in a sturdy plastic container, and priced competitively.  With Amazon's free shipping, it's a great value."
1633,"This is a great buy/great value, two cans/high volume for this price, for the great quality of this product... highly suggest for all those chai lovers!"
1634,"I was a little skeptical about this product... canned veggies are normally pretty gross. This was fantastic though! I have to stop myself from eating them too quickly. It is a little pricey per can, but I think this with a side, such as some toast to put it on or something, is a full meal. Very filling and tasty. This can be taken anywhere, needs no cooking and comes complete with a spork. I will definitely be buying more of this and other products by St Dalfour Gourmet."
1635,`I was very pleased to see this product online.  I always bought Baby Girls canned food at Food Lion and now they no longer carry it at the local store.  Every cat and kitten who has had the pleasure of trying it loves it.  NOT gummy or looks like mystery meat.  Great product.
1636,"This is a really delicious cheese. The interior is about the consistency of a hard cheddar, maybe a little more crumbly, and suitable for cutting into snack size pieces. The description says it's somewhat like cheddar, but I find it more like a softer parmigiano, with a nutty sweetness along with the sharpness. Very nice with nuts and dates. It gets harder toward the outside, and works very well for grating like a hard parmigiano. The outermost part is quite hard.  I haven't tried to melt it, but it is delicious grated or shaved onto pasta dishes, salads and even into egg dishes.  I wish I could find it in our local upscale cheese shops - it's funny to me that while many of our restaurants are trying to use more local and California products, with cheese it seems to be that the farther away and more obscure the better. Too bad this comes from boring old Modesto, not some virgin-tended cave on an uncharted island off Sardinia."
1637,i love the taste of lavender but if you use to much it can be soapy tasting and thats just really bad..
1638,Zukes are great training treats because they are small and quickly consumed so you can continue what you're working on.  I've shopped everywhere for them and Amazon is the best price I've found so we order them frequently.
1639,"My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times."
1640,I tried this hoping that it would be another good GF staple in my pantry. I didn't like it as well as the other brand I buy. I combined the cooked pasta with a homemade GF cheese sauce and it was by far the worst GF Mac n' Cheese I've ever made. The pasta didn't combine with the sauce at all. I am going back to my tried and true Quinoa pasta.
1641,"These are seriously delicious, especially if you like plain potato chips. My only concern is they're very oily. I understand they're ""kettle chips"" and they're ""fried"" (small batches and all) but when you open the bag (That's another thing, very strong bag! Need scissors!) there's a coating of oil on the inside of the bag and on the chips themselves. I suggest a blot/shake on some paper towels before consuming. Either way, they have a yummy potato taste, and very satisfying crunch. Delicious!"
1642,"28.99 dollars for one pack? Are people stupid, you can buy these at the neares supermarket for less than 28.99, aybe 7 or 8 dollars, but not 28 for one pack..  I know is easy to buy online, but buying this, is just playing lazy!"
1643,"Loved the drink.  Just wish it did not cost as much as it does.  However, love the drink.  Tastes like an Almond Joy."
1644,This curry paste is amazing - it tastes the closest to the restaurant-quality panang than other sauces/pastes I've tried.  Good price.
1645,"Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.  I do cut up the larger pieces as I don't want to give them too much at once.  The prospect of getting one of these treats makes them much more receptive to training and just coming when you call.  Also, we find the largest size very economical as you don't pay for shipping."
1646,"Finally! I can indulge in a crunchy, tasty snack that I won't regret an hour later. My favorite is the sea salt and vinegar flavor -- not too much vinegar, and just the right amount of salt. (The plain Pop Chips are solid, too.) These chips are unbelievably light. They give me the same satisfaction as munching on popcorn, but with less guilt and hassle."
1647,"Jonsteen Company is an entrepreneurial wonder.  All of Jonsteen's seedlings and seed-growing kits are wonderful.  I have purchased many of their products, including Bonsai grow kits, and never been disappointed."
1648,"A lot for the money:  My friend makes a wonderful cherry bread, and these made the best she's ever made. We don't live convenient to a good source of dried fruit, so buying in bulk is great for us. If you love cherries, the flavor is excellent, and is not hindered by over-sweetening or by additives. A great way to add fruit in your diet. These do come in one large bag, so we divided them into convenient quantities in freezer bags and froze part of themThese cherries have a delicious flavor, and make a wonderful snack or addition to trail mix or breakfast cereal. The quality of the fruit is uniformly high, and the sunflower oil to keep them from sticking together works great."
1649,"I LOVE THIS TEA, ITS HARD TO FIND GOOD DECAF GREEN TEA AND<br />THIS IS THE BEST, VERY GOOD PRICE. I LIKE TO USE AS HOT TEA<br />AND COLD TEA BY SIMMERING 4 TEA BAGS IN A POT OF WATER, ADD A LITTLE<br />BIT OF HONEY, REMOVE FROM STOVE TOP AND LET SIT FOR A FEW HOURS<br />THEN POUR IN PICTURE IN REFREGIRATOR AND YOU GOT NICE HEALTHY TEA !<br />MY SON EVEN WILL DRINK IT !"
1650,I got a variety pack and these were in it.  They are my absolute favorite and taste great!
1651,"This is the best green tea I have ever had.That being said,I have only had green tea from bags,never in powder form,before this.This truly takes green tea to the next level.<br /><br />I do intend to buy a bamboo whisk,at this point I am using a wire whisk which does work.I have also just shaken it in water for iced tea which seems to work."
1652,I like to pop them in the microwave for a few seconds and eat them when they are warm. They taste like homemade!
1653,"This is a standard, yellow, German mustard with good tang and good body.  If you're not into mustards that are spicy, this one is sure to please."
1654,"I purchased these because of the low salt, and they were indeed low in salt. However, many, many of the chips in the bag were literally dripping in oil. I have never encountered this problem with other potato chip brands. It was very unappetizing, and who wants all that oil? I will never buy these again, and I would not recommend them to others."
1655,"I admit, I was very skeptical of this mix, since it has most a rice flour base. Most of the products we enjoy have a blend of flours, including bean and sorghum. However, I heard good things from other at our Celiac group, and tried it in a fruit cobbler recipe in one of Bette Hagaman's books. It was SO good! Everyone enjoyed it, and couldn't tell it was GF.<br /><br />Now, making it as a cobbler may have meant that it had plenty of moisture to avoid the dry taste some others have mentioned, so if I make it as a plain cake or cupcakes, I will try the suggestion for the pudding mix and increase the liquids slightly. However, you can't beat the price. In our local supermarket, it is far cheaper than other GF products, and only a tad bit more than non-GF cake mix. Amazon's subscription-price isn't much lower than our supermarket, so I'll still buy it there. We've had well-meaning people ask over the years what they can buy to make for my son, and I haven't wanted to burden them with the typical expense of GF mixes. This product is available everywhere and is very reasonably priced, so kudos to Betty Crocker!!!"
1656,THis is a great flavored coffee. Enjoy this flavor after a meal or mid afternoon. Smooth flavor and wonderful aroma. Anyone who comes into kitchen when it is brewing wants to try a cup.
1657,"I have recently joined Jenny Craig as  I need to lose some weight, and these 100 Calorie Pack cookies are the greatest thing for snacks.  I appreciate the opportunity to get them from you so reasonably. I have agreed to take a shipment each month."
1658,Sent to our Arizona son on 9/7/2012....<br />he has not gotten it yet.  Will write a review later.  It looks like a fun hing for the pups.
1659,"I got these in the mail today, i know right, sounds so weird to say i got hash browns in the mail, haha.  Come in dry ice cooler and were in box all in their own lil plastic bags.  Just stick them on a baking sheet for 35 min. at 400 degrees.  when you get them out of the oven you smell the cheese and it has nice crunchy outside with creamy potato inside, if you want the best side dish to your steak or other meat, hey could even use for breakfast with some eggs and sausage, your choice, this get a 5/5 for taste, 5/5 for presentation, buy these now, great price too, thanks for your time, and thank you omaha steaks, the best at great prices."
1660,"I don't know who created these treats, but my puppy loves them.  They have a dog smell so I would recommend you keep the packaging sealed or your dog will get into the package!!!"
1661,"i used to be able to buy this at target, but they dont carry it anymore, so i bought it through amazon"
1662,"I have tried several brands of canned pumpkin for my dogs (and cat).  My veterinarian recommended it to help them naturally express their anal glands, which saves them a lot of pain and discomfort at the groomers.  (And helps the cat move hair through his system).  Using pumpkin has helped them a lot.  I like this brand because it is not as pricey as those that are sold specifically for pets, and it is a solid consistency (not as loaded with water as some other brands), and it is organic (just makes me feel a bit better), and it is reasonably priced (especially with the 15% discount for setting it up as a subscription item).  And there you have it!"
1663,We cannot find this pancake syrup anywhere in our local area. This is the reason we purchased it on Amazon. It is so good. We think it is the best syrup out there. We shared it with our family and friends. We are nervous to order anymore because we like it too much. You will not regret this purchase.
1664,"I like the jars because they are a little cheaper then the plastic gerber containers, but they don't reseal as easy.  If you keep the open food in the fridge for the recomended time there is no problem."
1665,This product came in a timely manner & seems to be in perfect shape & at a great price. My only concern was that the seal didn't actually have to be even broken to open the container. It seems fine though & I am using it as usual w/ no problems. :)
1666,The Southern Mills gravy is  a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes.<br /><br />The mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. It hits the table and it is gone.... everyone seems to love it.
1667,"This is a great cat food and my two cats have been on Science Diet since they were kittens.  Though this is a great product, beware of the prices from the seller ""Monster Pets""!!! They are charging $25 for a 7-pound bag of cat food, when you can purchase a 15-pound bag from Petco for about $30 (you get about twice as much for $5 more).  I feel this company is being dishonest to their customers... Do not waste your money buying from this particular dealer."
1668,I put 2 drops into 3 scrambled eggs and mixed it up well. I took one bite and spit it out within 5 seconds and this junk burned the heck out of me.<br /><br />I'm not Mr. Hot Food but I do like spicy food. This stuff may not be poison but it isn't food in my opinion. What kind of people make a dopey product like this? There is a mild warning and a caution to use a drop at a time but that warning is inadequate.<br /><br />It was about 10 minutes of legitimate suffering that was completely unnecessary.<br /><br />Don't buy this junk!
1669,"when i recieved my cake it was frozen in dry ice. i was a little worried it would be dry, but the cake thawed out to a moist delicious treat lots of nuts, and creamy frosting. i will buy agin."
1670,"These beans were just as described and I got 71 of them in my 1/2 lb package!  Like others, I was making vanilla and these worked perfectly.  They were moist and easy to cut.  Extras were saved (one thrown in with the sugar) for the next round of vanilla making!"
1671,"We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic ""replicators"", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station."
1672,The product arrived right on its scheduled time. This shake is great for pre or post workout. I absolutely love it. It tastes good with milk or even water. Definitely a great way to help lose weight and stay healthy
1673,"I bought a Keurig brewer last Christmas and have been sampling all the different varieties. I enjoy being able to have a variety of good fresh coffee on hand. I like the darker roasts like French and the 'Jet Fuel' brand which is a good roast. This Italian Roast is my absolute favorite, strong and full of flavor. :) I am ordering another box of 50 today."
1674,"The spicy thai beef jerky makes for a quick high-protein snack between meals. I would give it five stars if there weren't some tough, unchewable pieces in every bag. The tender pieces are very good."
1675,"This is one of our favorite K-cup's, we have a pack of 50 delivered every month!"
1676,"The product was fine, but the cost of shipping was more than the cost<br />of the tea.  Won't make that mistake again."
1677,"This seems to be the only option for readily available compostable tall kitchen bags.  Other similar bags listed here are biodegradable, but not compostable.  So, this appears to be the only legal option for residents of San Francisco, California.  The other bags contain plastic, these don't.<br /><br />That said, they are pretty good bags.  Sure, they are thin, and can get clammy when wet.  But, I've not yet had one break.  They only need to make it from the can to the curb, so that's not much to ask.  I just noticed that they claim to have been recently redesigned.  The size is also a bit different (they are now a bit taller and skinnier).  And, they come in a smaller box.  I haven't tried these new bags yet.<br /><br />My only complaint was that they were made in Norway, so they have to be shipped quite a distance.  How good for the environment can that be?  The new bags don't list a production country on the outside of the package.  Are they now made in the USA?"
1678,"I was so happy to see all twelve cans in pristine condition and with ""use by"" dates two years off stamped on the tops.  Another highly pleasant surprise came when I had my first taste.  This pumpkin is without a doubt better tasting than Libby's.  With the Subscribe and Save discount, this superior product actually costs a tad less than what I pay for Libby's at my local store.  And with the added convenience of home delivery!  I use a couple cans each week because it is loaded with nutrients and fiber and being a thick puree it is very useful in creating good things to eat.  I have put about a tablespoon on a dish for my cat twice and she ate it up both times which rather amazed me."
1679,"Since all Greenies are the same I would suppose that only the suppliers of Greenies could make the difference, and this one certainly did!<br />We received our order for an amazing cocker spaniel in very good time, which made us all very happy!<br />And as far as price goes, that was really a surprise!<br />Even with postage these healthy treats cost less than we had been paying for them in pet stores here in Salt Lake City!<br />You can surely look forward to many more orders from us!<br />Thanks for the great treatment!!!!<br />Ray, Joan and Taz<br /><br />PS  I HAVE NO IDEA OF HOW THE IDENTIFYING PICTURE OF THE PRODUCT I REVIEWED GOT SWITCHED!<br /><br />HOWEVER, PLEASE DO NOT LET YOUR DOG EAT THE MICROFIBER CLOTHS (EVEN THE GREEN ONES)!!!!!!!!!"
1680,"I was getting tired of Luna Bars, so I'm soooo happy I found these. Even my kids like them and I'll occasionally use them as as a snack for school or as a quick breakfast.  Not quite as yummy as the peanut butter variety, but I usually buy a box of each and switch off flavors."
1681,"Badshah Punjabi Garam Masala.<br />Garam Masala is a quintessential ingredient in various dishes of Indian Cuisine.  It is a powdered mixture of whole spices that is used to elevate the taste and aroma of a dish.  It can be quite strong so a little bit goes a long way.  I have used several different brands and types of Garam Masalas and this one is by far my favorite. It's not hot and the aroma is amazing.<br />The ingredients mentioned on the box are as follows: Coriander, Black pepper, Cumin, Tejpatta, Clove, Green cardamom, Black cardamom, Cassia, Anistar, Dry Ginger, Nutmeg, Mace, and Caraway<br />Unfortunately, I couldn't find it in any Indian store around and was delighted to find it at amazon. I actually like it so much that I don't mind paying for the shipping and Ive stocked up in my pantry.  It arrived well packaged and wasn't old stock. I will definitely order again when I run out of these."
1682,We use this on fish also. It is a great seasoning and is a low cal solution to a great meal.
1683,"Greenies dental chews are a product that my dogs love to eat.  Around 6:30-7:00 my dogs start to bark, jump up, follow me everywhere because it's time for their Greenies.  Best thing I ever got for them."
1684,"Good for rehydrating after a workout. The taste of the powder isn't very strong, so if you're looking for something with significant flavor, you'll have to use a lot. Two heaping spoonfuls for a full glass of water is what I'll use. The pineapple flavor tastes like faintly sweetened pineapple, not like coconut water, so if you like the taste of coconut water and that's what you're looking for, I'd get the original flavor instead. For a flavor blast, try mixing this into orange juice. It's DELICIOUS."
1685,"Very good baby food, good taste and texture.  The baby gobbled it down and I snuck a taste to find it was really good.  I like the organic nature of it - I feel good feeding him something that I feel is better than processed food."
1686,This tea is very delicious. I mean VERY. It's the perfect drink for me after a long work day. It is truely relaxing and will put you right to sleep.
1687,"I ordered these without having tried them before- I tried a similar product made by a different brand (possibly a slightly different flavor?) and loved them, so when I saw these I thought ""yes!"" and ordered the bulk pack.<br />When I tasted them, however, my stomach said, ""no!""  These are disgusting.  I repeat: disgusting.  They taste like ketchup, mustard, LOTS of sugar and EGG.  Which mixed together tastes like vomit.  Say, what you might expect after eating cotton candy and a corn dog and an omelet and then riding the tilt-a-whirl.  I have tried them several times to see if it is ""an acquired taste"" but, for me, it is not.  These make me nauseous every time.  Too bad.  I really wanted to like them.  Anyone want 4 and a half bags of this?"
1688,This is very tasty!  We have tried other<br />k cup hot chocolates and feel this is the best option.
1689,"Pink was a little brighter than I had hoped for but mixed with a little white it was perfect, this is my favorite fondant to use to cover my cakes ."
1690,"My cat absolutely loves this flavor. Normally, I have to coax her to finish her food, but when I give her a serving of Chicken & Herring, the bowl is clean in like five minutes. I do not understand why some of the other reviewers blamed the company for selling them bad cans--their cats probably just prefer another flavor. I say experiment to see what your cat will eat, and stay away from cat food with grains in it!"
1691,"Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it.  I put a Kong liver snap treat (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DHNY6"">KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large</a>) in the Kong (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002AR0I8"">KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red</a>) first, then ""anchor"" it with the liver paste.  I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog.  Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.<br /><br />She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted.  This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING.  Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz........."
1692,"A lot of people are complaining about the fact that these come in a brown bag. They are in a brown bag, INSIDE of an amazon box. So it's not as if they are in danger of being crushed in the mail. I got a couple of teas mixed in, which is fine with me. I got some great choices. It seems a bit random,  but that is ok with me because I am a new user and wanted to try lots of choices and see what I really liked.<br /><br />So far I really love the Pumpkin Spice, the Cinnamon Roll and Supreme Vanilla. I would order again."
1693,"I like the product, but why would amazon sell an item that expires soon. They should provide the expiration date before you buy."
1694,"Chef Paul's Fajita Magic is magic in my mouth. Any time we are cooking some mexi-food, it is used. Even if it's not fajitas. So delicious. Not overly salty like the cheap ones you find in the grocery store."
1695,"Willy, my 14 pound poodle and Gracie my 15 pound Carin terrier both love these everlasting treat balls. We purchased them each their own medium size ball. Takes them approx 6 hours of licking time to make a hollow in the side of one treat. They have never been able to pop one out and the toy itself looks like it is still brand new after being used every day for about 9 months now. It's their favorite watching TV with Mom and Dad treat !"
1696,"These cookies are VERY, VERY chocolaty! You may need a glass of (rice) milk to tame down the flavor.  I ate mine with vanilla frosting to help balance out the chocolate."
1697,"What is so great about this tea is it's ability to be brewed in almost any way provided water is below boiling temp as with all green tea. What is missed by making this a 1 cup at a time tea is the immensity of the brew when it's allowed to truly form in the pot. It's true that the pungent orange blossoms are strong, but when given enough room to expand the initial sharp taste becomes a subtle aftertaste. And that's how the green tea works into your system with such ease, because you're gradually absorbing the taste of it tempered by the orange. Want proof of this add any other citrus like apple for instance and see how the orange will gladly stay in the background for it. Or for those who make Kombucha try an amazing base for it with this tea. And no tea will complement my organic beer as well. There's been times where I have drank myself dizzy on the green tea just because I was so absorbed in the brewing flavors. But even after taking a break from it the want of it always comes back and that's how I know the tea is true because like the other reviewers not many appeal to me. I've been drinking this tea solid for about 2 years now nearly every day - more than once a day always - letting the pot sit on a warmer on top of the wood stove during cold weather. When the weather is warm a hot pot in the morning makes an excellent ice tea in the afternoon and evening as well."
1698,"I am picky about certain things and what I drink is one of them. NOBODY in this area carries the coffee any more.<br />The order was easy, the coffee came before I expected it, everything was perfect! I will order again later. Love It!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P6XVLU"">Hill Bros. Skinny Latte Fat-Free Caramel, 15 oz jars (pack of 3)</a>"
1699,"These chips are very good in taste and with more than the usual grams of fiber, a good choice.  They came very fresh and in good shape--no crushed bags."
1700,Very hard to find these locally.  Glad I'm able to get them.  One of the things I love from my childhood.
1701,"The spice variety is one of my favorites-- it has a nice cinammon quality without being too overpowering like a lot of spice teas i've had. also, guayusa is a pretty amazing product in itself. Big thumbs up."
1702,Jello cook and serve is the best and it's nice and tart.  We enjoy it by itself and it's also a key part of a cake I make: yellow cake with lemon filling and mocha frosting.  Hard to find in stores.  So happy Amazon carries it.
1703,"I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation."
1704,"The quality of this product is fine, but I wish I'd sprung for a couple more bucks and gotten the Spanish paprika. I think it would have had more flavor."
1705,"I never thought I could brew as good a cup of coffee as a fine restaurant until I bought the Dark Roast from the Organic Coffee Company. The aroma, the taste, are out of this world.  And I'm not usually a dark roast kind of drinker.  No bitterness, no after taste, like I find w/ the St*** brand so nationally prevalent.<br /><br />Also, because of the lack of customer advertising/awareness, I was able to get this coffee for only $4.00 per 12oz bag.  Almost the most inexpensive coffee on the rack.  This was at a super market chain located in New England.  But lately, the store has been discontinuing it, so as I look online, I can only find the same coffee for $10 or more per bag.  Sigh."
1706,"While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea packets are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
1707,"This is just so delicious. We consider food just a vehicle for this sauce. Not too spicy, has a nice flavor and the large bottle is huge! I bought a jar for my husband for Hanukkah (yes, there will be Valentina flavored latkes this year). We cannot find it where we live and are grateful it is on Amazon. The shipping was super fast and the bottle was wrapped very well to prevent breaking. Thank you."
1708,We love this coffee for the office and home. Great flavor but not too acidic or oily.
1709,Great for a snack food on a bun or for a meal in the microwave or on the stove-top. Has savory flavor with cubes of beef and vegetables. Excellent value for the price without a lot of calories.
1710,"I found this seasoning a long time ago at a my local chain grocery store. Suddenly, one day they stopped carrying it and i could not find it anywhere. This stuff is great and the price is right on it, since you would pay more from the manufacturer."
1711,"Coffee tastes great on the small mug setting(7.25 oz), anything beyond that is too weak for me - unless you use 2 K-cups & brew each one on the 5.25 oz.  This coffee is robust but not bitter. Highly recommend it."
1712,"There's nothing like a Coca-Cola with REAL sugar.  I live for Passover time when I can get Kosher Coke at the local supermarket, which also has real sugar.  For the in between times, I like to grab some Mexi-Coke.  It's so much better than the regular Coke that is readily available at my local supermarket.  If I didn't have a place close to my home where I could get it, I might consider paying the $21 here on Amazon.  But since I can go to Wegman's and get a whole case (24 bottles) for $1 LESS than it costs for the 6 bottles here, I'll pass.  5 Star product - 1 Star price.  (I split the difference with 3 stars for the review.)  If you don't have Wegman's near you, consider taking advantage of this offer.  If there's a Wegman's close to you, just go there and get a case."
1713,I must say that this was a great offer.  I use my Keurig Brewer everyday and this was my favorite coffee.  I shop everyday on Amazon because of all the good deals and more important I trust Amazon that what they are selling is just as they described it.  I have bought coffee from many places but this was the best price.  Keep up the good work Amazon.  Thanks!
1714,Just got this soup in today and I had to try it.  It is wonderful!<br />The seasonings are just right and it is so creamy and easy to fix.<br />You can add just about anything you want to make it your own personal recipe.  I think I will add broccoli and cheese next time for a change.<br />It is wonderful just like the recipe is.<br />Highly recommend!  Will definitely buy more.
1715,"I think this coffee is an absolutely delicious eye opener.<br /><br />It fills the room with a mixed blend of fragrances of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.It's ingredients are all organic and a wonderful combination.<br /><br />It doesn't smell as wonderful in the bag as it does when heated. This is a savory way to start the day. Not just great for the holidays, but especially nice anytime during the cold weather. Highly recommended."
1716,"Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that."
1717,"My husband and I really like these meals.  They are so convenient when you're in a rush and we love the taste.<br />Have to say that the serving size is a little off, or maybe we're just overeaters.  We use 2 boxes with rice on the<br />side, cucs and yogurt, a little chutney and naan (or pita if we don't have any). High in fat so don't have as often<br />as we'd like."
1718,We were using Harney & Sons apricot tea but we decided to try this brand. We weren't disappointed. It is really good apricot tea. We actually use it to brew iced tea and it is great.<br /><br />Good product. Highly recommended.
1719,"This is hard to find in our grocery stores, so glad I can order it, and it's less than what it is on the shelf.<br /><br />That is what I posted the first time I ordered this product, which sold for 25.20.  I had it in my cart to order a 3rd time, and after they held my order for shipping for a month, it was then cancelled the week it was to ship.  I went to reorder it and the price had jumped to 62.50 for the same product, same amount. To charge over 30 dollars more for the same product a month later I find absolutely ridiculous."
1720,"I have four cats and they love this product. It is the only food I would consider giving them, since the stopped selling Dr. Weil's Pet Promise. There are very similar."
1721,"My 5 month old french bulldog puppy almost died on the first bone tonight.  He chewed it down and attempted to swallow a piece that was too big to go down his throat.  When he began gagging and throwing up I had to stick my hand down his throat to push the lodged bone into his stomach.  VERY scary and upset me greatly.  I do NOT recommend these bones.  There is even a choking warning on the back in small writing.  Keep your pet safe and purchase MUCH BIGGER bones for them, and take away anything too small so they cannot choke or get hurt."
1722,"I received a sample package of Wheaties Fuel Cereal with my local Sunday newspaper last week.  It tasted VERY good -- so good, in fact, that it has become my new favourite cereal!  It must be a combination of the<br />sugar, honey, brown sugar syrup, and cinnamon that gives it a totally unique, totally delicious sweetness.<br /><br />This cereal is a ""multi-type"" cereal, in that not all parts of it look the same.  Darker flakes mix with lighter, rice-crispies-like nuggets, and with small clusters seemingly made from the flakes, to create a visually-different cereal that is almost as exciting to see as it is to eat!<br /><br />It also has an ""OU-Dairy"" seal, from the Jewish Orthodox Union, for those to whom things being kosher is important.<br /><br />On the nutritional good side, this cereal boasts 5 grams of fiber, in every 210 caloorie, 3/4 cup serving. It also has more of a percentage of vitamins and minerals, (ranging from 4% to 110%), of any cereal I have ever seen.  On the bad side, it has 14 grams of sugar per seving.  (Don't eat too much of this cereal at once....or your heart will start racing!)<br /><br />Also to be noted, is that wheat products of ANY kind, and ANY variety of rice, corn, and oil, (with which this particular cereal is LOADED), are said to be bad for the eyes.  So -- balance eating this cereal with eating eggs and drinking tea -- both of which are said to be good for your eyes.<br /><br />This cereal is now the ""official"" cereal of The Ironman Triathalon -- so you know it's got to have SOME sort of superiour nutrition.  On the back of the package are portraits of five male sports stars: Hunter Kemper - Triathalon Champion, Kevin Garnett - Basketball Champion, Peyton Manning - Football Champion, Albert Pujols, and Bryon Clay -- Decathalon Champion,  They all look very strong and very sure of themselves -- AND as if they are challenging the viewer to join them......<br /><br />I wondered why there were no other boxes of Wheaties' Fuel Cereal with WOMEN athletes on them, and called up the General Mills phone number on the box to ask.  I mentioned too, that years ago there had been a commercial which had the jingle: ""He's ready for Wheaties / He knows he's a man!"" -- and that because of this jingle, I, a woman, had been afraid to even try Wheaties!  She assured me that she would pass my suggestion -- that there be another box, with women basketball players, ski champions, ballet dancers, ice skaters, and the like, on it -- on to her supervisors.<br /><br />In the meantime, I'm glad I got this particular 14-box collection.  It drives down the cost of each box.  I also intend to put some of this cereal into my blender, turn it into crumbs, and use it instead of breadcrumbs in a number of dishes.<br /><br />When eaten in reasonable amounts, this sugary-cereal- with-lots-fiber can, I think, be very good for one.<br />Only -- don't overdo eating it, even though it is quite sweet, and quite delicious!"
1723,"My cat won't touch it at all, which is a pity, since its ingredients look healthy. She usually loves new food.  So when she resisted the food so much, I thought she was ill and took her to the vet, had a x-ray taken to check if she'd swallowed some things that got stuck.  She turned out to be fine. I then tried Iams, which she loves right away.<br /><br />Castor & Pollux doesn't respond to my inquiry.  ZERO customer service!"
1724,My wife and I loved this rice.  It is rich and creamy.  It goes well with any chicken or beef dish.  When we moved from NY to CA we could no longer find it.  We started ordering it online.
1725,"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater."
1726,"An exception to the ""what's good for you , isn't good"" theory. Just the right amount of vanilla and blueberry taste make these delicious ! Don't really know what flax seeds are , but there included too.<br />The crunch and taste was very satisfying , and anything that I can put in myself that is healthy and tasty I will buy."
1727,"These dog treats are the same as the kibble that I feed my dog. My dog was vomiting for no apparent reason. After my dog's veterinarian told us about the food, I started her on it and after a week on it she stopped vomiting...that was four years ago. The dog treats are the same as the kibble. They come in two different sizes (small for small dogs and puppies and medium for medium sized dogs). My dog is 47 pounds and about 20 inches tall and I feed her the medium sized treats. Sometimes I find that the bone shaped treats split in layers so they are thinner than usual but my dog doesn't seem to mind."
1728,"Still debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6). I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta. I am happy that another low carb pasta is available for purchase for it is to my advantage to eat the low carb pasta. The last time I had regular pasta was a long time ago. Between the two pastas mentioned above I no longer feel I am missing much. 4 Stars!"
1729,These cookies really satisfy my sweet tooth for chocolate chip cookies. Very tasty and doesn't make me feel so sugar deprived.
1730,"I was sick of spending $1.25 per bag from our vending machine at work, and just don't have the self control to buy a big bag & ration it out.  I was thrilled I found these on Amazon as are so much cheaper to buy in bulk, and since individually wrapped keeps me in check for portion control. I love this flavor & now I'm stocked up for a few weeks, & will definately order more when I've eaten these."
1731,"Those that say these peppers are not hot must eat this stuff a lot, or just have no sense of heat. Everyone I let try these have said these peppers are crazy hot. I would not eat them straight out of the package because they can get stuck to the back of your thought and cause some trouble."
1732,"Not bad, Not great, but good coffee. Put it on my list so if I can not get my first choice, I have a backup."
1733,"My dog is absolutely crazy about these treats, and that they are made in the U.S.A. is just icing on the cake."
1734,"Grows delightfully and it is a pleasure to watch it, either by yourself or with the person you share the cup of tea."
1735,this product is very nice and i am happy i found a way to purchase it. i was able to make a couple of healthy sized burgers from each box instead of the recommended '6' but i was very glad to not find any animal products in the ingredients. the price seems reasonable if purchased 35 boxes at a time.
1736,"My husband can't eat onions and this is the only salsa I've found that doesn't have onions in it. This salsa is fantastic. The more you eat, the hotter it gets."
1737,"I have a golden retriever with severe skin allergies, and after switching him to this food, his allergies are non-existant. The change was not immediate, but after 6 months his skin started to heal from his hot spots, and one year later you can't even tell where he used to chew himself! He has a beautiful full coat of hair and doesn't chew even during allergy season. Great dog food!"
1738,"I've tried products such as Baja Bobs which has icky aspartame, with a bad after taste.  Go Cocktails has taken it to a new level sweetening their products with what is essentially Splenda."
1739,"I had expected this tea to have a stronger fragrance and flavor however, it is more like a hint of cinnamon and a hint of vanilla.  The subtle flavor makes it a tea I can drink more frequently than I actually was expecting.<br /><br />As with all Stash teas the individual bags are easy to transport and the tea stays fresh.<br /><br />On the whole, it is a great product, even if it's not what I expected."
1740,"Best jerky I've had hands down. Better than Pemmican and Jack Links. Tender, flavorful and nice and thick. Excellent product, will keep on purchasing!"
1741,"Our cats seem to love this much more than other treats we've been using. However, it made one of them vomit in two different instances, immediately after eating this. Obviously this is not the case with other reviewers here, but I thought I should point that out in case someone else is having the same experience."
1742,"My wife's favorite tea, she lives on this stuff! Very difficult to find even though we live a stones throw from Baltimore. Wish we could find it in the old red and green box with not every bag individually wrapped."
1743,very happy with it. My husband and I use herbs from it frequently. It produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use.
1744,"I ordered this item for myself and it arrived very quickly.  The flavor is good if not a little sweet.  I liked it so much that I wanted to order for my sister in law. Placed the order and selected next day delivery to surprise her.  Well, that did not happen.  I would have at least expected a heads up from the supplier that next day delivery was not going to happen.  I am very disappointed!!"
1745,Boxes arrived in great condition and in a timely manner. I can't wait to see what my children think of these crazy jelly beans.
1746,This fondant taste great and is easy to work with.  Easy to roll out and takes very little kneading to make it pliable to work with.
1747,"For the price I get a ton of oat bran and you can do very many things with it. I prefer this 1000% over oatmeal. I can't eat oatmeal, but can have this every morning"
1748,"I like this for a quick chicken soup or noodle dish. It's also good in chicken salad, on a veggie salad, or in quasadas with cheese. I like it for it's simplicity & time saving features. I like this very much. I also keep some in my emergency food supplies. Good Stuff."
1749,"the flavor of this salt is wonderful, it is light and unique. I love it. plus it has all the minerals we are missing from our refined salt that we buy at the grocers.A++++++"
1750,Have had a hard time finding this coffee in the supermarket and I am thrilled that I can now order it online.  Its a tasty cappuccino and I enjoy it.
1751,"We have been trying out decafs to find good strong ones. I was so hopeful when I opened the box covered with exclamations of  'BAM!' and 'Oh Yeah, Babe!'. That first cup was a huge watery letdown. I can only say that it is not acidic. I tried it a few more times and now it is the coffee that the kids are allowed to drink. Weak, sad decaf."
1752,"My parents were visiting us in Las Vegas from the east coast. I was at my favorite grocery store and as we passed the chips I said ""you have to try these chips, (my wife and I have been hooked for some time now) my mother said that she doesn't buy chips since they are too greasy. I said I promise you will love these. When we got home I opened the bag and handed it to them. They loved them. When they returned home I got a call from my parents telling me they went to every healthy store around and no one sells them. I sent a case to their home since you can not get them on the east coast and they are almost finished with them. Time to order another case. BEST CHIPS EVER. We keep many bags in the house."
1753,"I live on the Mendocino Coast in Northern California where these are collected. In fact my wife makes frequent trips to get some fresh. Sea Palm is one of my favorites. I like the natural process that Rising Tide Sea Vegetables uses to dry their products. everything is done naturally without any acceleration process. A little known fact is that Sea Veggies from our neck of the woods are some of the best in the world. Japan has always imported ours, long before the disaster. Enjoy before they are gone."
1754,"The manufacturer claims these snack bars are made with organic, vegan ingredients. The top four ingredients, as listed, are organic date paste, organic rolled oats, organic brown rice syrup, and strawberry puree. While it's clear these bars are nutritious and very possibly wholesome, they don't really taste good.  In fact, they look kind of ugly and unappetizing upon opening, and sort of smells funny, too.<br /><br />Each bar weighs 48 oz. and packs 180 calories, 20 of which from fat. There's 0g saturated fat and 0g trans fat (remember, 0g means anything less than 0.5g, since these guys are allowed to round the numbers). Cholesterol is 0mg and sodium 20mg. Total carbs is 34g, with 4g of dietary fiber and 22g of sugar, not great if you're diabetic.<br /><br />In short, if you love wholesome foods, you'll probably like this. But if you want healthy foods that also taste decent, this is probably not it, but perhaps still worth a try.<br /><br />Box says ""made in the USA,"" but no mention of where the ingredients come from."
1755,Our dogs adore getting treated but one has reactions to some dog treats.  I am satisfied that these treats are healthy and they definately are enjoyed.
1756,"You throw the paste in a pan with water and fish.  Simmer for 10 min.  Done.  Amazing.<br /><br />If you don't like spicy, this isn't for you."
1757,"This powdered green tea is very good and a consistent quality.  I make it hot.  But if I don't have time to drink it, it is still great cold.  You can find it cheaper elsewhere though."
1758,If this is a snack it looks like it. The pieces remind me of cheese puffs. Their texture is puffy and it was hard for my dog to chew and swallow. The smell was appetizing even to us humans but my dog was actually scared of it after several attempts to swallow it. It has no weight and only puffed up space so it obviously has no nutritional value.
1759,"This is my new fave rice vermicelli - since I purchased this case, I've cooked it virtually daily with homemade asian stock, chopped veggies & seasonings - it's perfect!<br /><br />Go for it!"
1760,Love these almonds!  Great flavor -- really hits the spot when those mid-afternoon hunger cravings set in! You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
1761,"Long time online shopper, but first time ever writing a review. We have a 7 month old Great Dane pup. When we got her at 12 weeks, the breeder had her eating Holistic Select Giant breed puppy food, which was good for awhile. Then her stool became very loose. So upon reading other reviews we switched to Eagle Pack Giant breed puppy food. Her stool was still a little loose, but we thought that it was possibly the switch of the foods so we wanted to give it a chance. Well after about 5-30lb. bags of eagle pack, her stool was still very loose and she was eating her and our other dogs poop. (very gross to be kissed by that....YUCK) A friend told us that she was doing that because she was missing a vitamin or supplement in her diet. She was also consuming a tremendous amount of food as well as always voraciously hungry. We started researching what to do then all of the sudden she was having uncontrollable diarrhea, not good for a 100lb. puppy. We did not have time for anymore research we had to do something now!<br /><br />We ended up at a local store and discovered Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food. We decided to try a a 18lb bag, even though the protein levels were a couple percentage points higher than we had been told to give a Great Dane. But the list of ingredients was wonderful when compared with a lot of other top brands, I am no expert but just reading the long list of ingredients it seemed that they had more all natural ingredients, as opposed to the supplements that the others were putting in their food.<br /><br />We got it home and immediately made a complete switch from the Eagle Pack food she was on. We did not do the customary blending of foods for a week or so to introduce the new food and ween her off the old. We did not have time as her tummy was so upset, we also did not want anymore of the Eagle Pack in her system. She loved the taste and gobbled it up. Within about 24 hours her poops started to firm up a bit. This got progressively better as the week went by, but still a little soft as to make picking up difficult especially on grass. We added In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs to her food and presto she pretty much has a firm stool every time, She is also eating noticeably less food (YAY!$$$) which she seams to be getting better nourishment from it. She is also no longer eating poop (YAY!!!). We attribute that the little bit extra protein in this food is what she was missing from her diet. We are going to ween her off the In Clover Fresh Digest Daily Intestinal Aid for Dogs and see how she does without the supplement now that she is totally use to her new food.<br /><br />To sum it up:<br />1. Good quality ingredients<br />2. Less supplements than some other brands<br />3. Slightly higher protein than we would like, but it keeps her from eating poop so that is ok<br />4. Affordable<br />5. Retains more of the food so she eats less, which saves a fair amount of money.<br />6. Her coat is super shiny and healthy<br /><br />P.S. We also switched our senior citizen American Bulldog to the Eagle Pack Adult food, and she got a very loose stool as well, and she has never been loose a day in her life. We now have her on Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Large Breed Dry Dog Food, and she is great and very healthy as well."
1762,"I've tried all the light roast decafs and this is the VERY BEST!  Its light, not at all smoky like other brands, and it ""gets"" you in the back of the jaw with its zing. I dont know how else to describe it. Its absolutely the best.<br /><br />I drink it on its own all day and sometimes use it to add to a cup of flavored! yeah its THAT good!"
1763,"We cooked up this delicious soup for a holiday dinner party, and the pot was empty after the first course! It was easy to prepare and super flavorful. We received the mix as a gift, and hope to order our own to give out as gifts, too. The company website has tons of gift options - great for the holidays."
1764,"I'm very happy with the traps.  I put them out all over and<br />got the one cockroach that somehow snuck into the house<br />on the very first night that I set the traps out.  I also caught<br />two silverfish.  The trap gets five stars just for the cockroach.<br /><br />The neighborhood I'm in has these huge vw bug cockroaches<br />with dark shells.  I have to be careful to keep doors closed<br />at night so they won't sneak in.  I hate them because they<br />run when you scream or when you're about to smash them<br />with a shoe on the trash can.<br /><br />Anyways, first thing this morning after having the trap set up<br />last night I see this big cockroach was stuck in the trap and<br />still moving.  I panicked because I couldn't smash it with<br />anything since it was 3/4 in the trap and its head was sticking<br />out and I had nothing to smash with handy.  I squirted maybe 1/4<br />cup of dish detergent onto it because I remembered reading<br />somewhere on internet that cockroaches breathe through their<br />skin.  After it got coated in soap I then was afraid the soap<br />would dissolve the sticky stuff in the trap and set the bugger<br />loose, but happily it struggled and died in the trap.<br />I only had to clean soap off that I squirted but that's okay<br />because cockroaches leave scent trails that need to be washed<br />off to prevent other buggers from following the trail.<br />If you don't squirt the cockroach, the trap and surrounding<br />area will be nice and clean and dry.  The sticky stuff inside<br />the traps stays inside.<br /><br />The traps are a bit hard to separate since you are tearing along<br />a perforation in cardboard after removing a divider strip to<br />separate two traps, but once you get the hang of how to do it,<br />it is okay. I was able to easily handle the traps and not get any<br />of the sticky stuff from inside the traps onto my hands.  Its<br />great that there is no toxic poisonous stuff in the traps."
1765,"Tastes great, and had zero problems with the packaging and brewing. WONDERFUL product. Definitely recommend it to coffee lovers and Keurig owners."
1766,Please dont feed your dog ONLY this. The only reason for the 2 stars is that i mix 4oz of this stuff into every cup of dry food and my pit loves it. She is a very picky eater and will refuse to eat any dry dog food.
1767,My family and I loved these cookies a little bit too much. I think they only lasted 24 hours in my house with a family of 5 that is not good. They tasted yummy. I liked the gooey middle. They are Chips Ahoy goodness with a bit of an extra bit of goodness.
1768,"I have a 12 1/2 year old Golden Retriever who has worn her teeth almost completely down.  The Barkster treats are very crunchy and yet very easy for her to chew as they break apart easily.  Also, due to less activity due to her arthritis, the Barksters are low in calories which is a big help.  I really am pleased to have found them available on Amazon.  Thank you."
1769,"7 of 12 cans were bent significantly.  I believe it is due to no barries between cans.  I love, love, love amazon subscribe and save, but I have found that canned items and sometimes boxed liquids do fare well.  I don't hesitate to order papers goods, electronices, clothes, etc. but I wouldn't order anything canned if it weren't for Amazon's excellent policy on credits for damaged goods.  Will try this product again and update if 12 cans show up not dented."
1770,"This is a complete waffle mix. You really just have to add water. We add regular water at first, and at the very end Seltzer water, this way you get a very fluffy excellent waffle as a result. We highly enjoy this waffle mix and would recommend to any waffle lovers out there."
1771,"Those cookies in small packages is very good.  It is very nice to open just one pack instead of a large package of cookies.  Also, you get a great variety of Chips Ahoy, Nutter Butter and Mini Oreos!  It's a great idea for a sweet treats for small kids and big kids, too!"
1772,"Was very excited to receive this awesome unit, but the one I received was used with food on it. very disappointed:("
1773,"If you're looking for a drink to quench your thirst, no need to look any further. Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice in Blackberry will satisfy your cravings for a fizzy fruitful drink without the strong carbonation that most soft drinks usually have.  Imagine drinking your favorite sparkling cider but with more of the rich fruity flavor enriched in the drink.  That is what it tastes like when you get a hold of Izze.  Also, there are two other great things about it, low in caffeine and not too sweet; so, you'll have to look elsewhere for something to add a little jolt to your day.<br /><br />And although it may be consumed without refrigeration, it may taste better chilled or dispensed from the can into a glass filled with ice cubes, especially if you're drinking on a hot summer day. Either way, you're in for a cool and refreshing drink any time of the season.  In addition, it also comes in grapefruit, Clementine, and apple flavor."
1774,"I have been using this product for about 5 years now.  When my then 3 year old son was diagosed with celiac disease and couldn't part with his pancakes, I began a search for suitable gluten free mixes - and this was the clear winner!  It doesn't have a ""beany"" taste (from garbanzo flour) that some of the other mixes have and the texture is very similar to ""traditional"" pancakes. The entire family thinks that the pancakes are delicious - and for more flavor, you can add milk instead of water to the mix.  I've used the mix for biscuits, last minute pizza crusts, cookies and pot pie topper.  This is a staple in our home gluten-free pantry."
1775,"This bar tastes just like a peanut butter cookie!<br /><br />It is truly amazing.  There is no flour, sugar, eggs, chemicals, preservatives, or anything bad.<br /><br />There are only natural, healthy ingredients.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for vegans.<br /><br />This bar is suitable for health-conscious people or people on a diet.<br /><br />If you like peanut butter cookies, but don't want to eat them because of all the bad stuff in them, then this bar should fill the bill and satsify your craving!!!!"
1776,Got these extracts for baking and smoothies to add variety in flavor. I put 1/2 capful in Crystal Light Orange and it was way yummy. This is great for those who are calorie conscious or going for a low glycemic way of eating since these extracts create a taste treat without doing damage.
1777,"My two cats share two 5 oz cans everyday. They love it. I give them varieties everyday; the Mideast seems their favorite dish. On behalf of my cats, I am a Weruva cat food fan now :)"
1778,"I'm no coffee aficionado but I know what doesn't suck, and this coffee doesn't. It works well in my stovetop espresso maker as well as in the ol' Bunn. When I use it in my French press it's pretty dreggy but I like it like that. Alls I can say is this coffee is bold and flavorful and has pretty much become my everday coffee."
1779,"I'm a perpetual dieter and I don't really have a huge sweet tooth so I'm kind of shocked at how much I like this product. It's way better than any other store bought frosting/glaze I've ever had. Where I live, one of the grocery stores makes chocolate cake donuts and this glaze and those donuts are to DIE for!<br /><br />You might be kind of surprised at the size of the bottle but not to worry, there's enough in there to more than cover a 9x13 inch cake.<br /><br />I don't use this to ""frost"" an entire cake. We like to take donuts or a piece of cake, microwave it until it's warm and then heat the glaze in the microwave for about 10 seconds and drizzle it onto the individual serving of cake. This is great for us because my husband and I are about as different as two people can get and he likes sweet stuff much more than I do so I can have less on my cake than he puts on his so we are both happy.<br /><br />This is good on chocolate muffins too and maybe the best thing about it is rather than having a large cake sitting around where I and my hubs are constantly tempted, we can just do one serving at a time.<br /><br />I've bought this several times now and will no doubt buy it again."
1780,"we love this product and buy it at trader joe's all the time, so i was very excited to find these 1 oz bags to put in the goodie bags (along with other healthy treats instead of the usual junky toys and candy kids normally get) for my daughter's birthday party. yumm yumm."
1781,This was the second flavor I tried and was not disappointed. The Cinnamon kicks each super bite up a notch. Looking forward to trying the other products!
1782,A ship fast. Safely arrived. Starbucks Via Colombia's fragrance is good. Now that is good at sharing out two.Will recommend it to others. The next time you are willing to buy.
1783,"Super service - can't ask for any better.  These arrived very quickly and as always, no problems at all.  A+++++++"
1784,"Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!"
1785,"For those that want a more ""natural"" soft drink, this is a good option because it has no added sugars. It still manages to pack 140 calories in an 8oz bottle so don't drink this regularly if you're trying to lose weight. The taste has good complexity but like most fruit drinks, is a little too sweet for my taste. I would definitely drink this instead of a typical artificial orange soda though."
1786,"I was a hardcore coffee drinker for 20 years. Suddenly, I was craving tea.  I tried many different kinds until I tried this tea and have been drinking it ever since. I love it!"
1787,"My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!"
1788,"My first thought when opening a pack of these...was wow! They have MUCH more filled then the classic ones do, and even more than like ""Double Stuff"" oreos do.<br /><br />The cookie its self has a unique flavor that I can best describe as a sweet buttery shortbread type flavor. It's definitely not one of those cookies where you take them apart to get to the filling, and forget about the cookies lol. They are fantastic, and CERTAINLY worth a try if you have never had them. I am a huge chocolate fan, but not usually too big on sweets. But these have and always will be a classic and my favorite.<br /><br />Pros: Everything.<br />Cons: I can eat a whole pack by myself. I blame Keebler fully for this."
1789,the cocoa was the best I ever had I am dibetic and it is hard to find good tasting stuff but this taste just like it has sugar but has splenda
1790,The garlic granules make cooking with the garlic flavor without adding extra salt.  The Tones quality is exceptional.  Arrived quickly
1791,"Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.<br /><br />If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.<br /><br />Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA."
1792,"These Krinkle sticks are a great way to get your crunchy, salty snack fix without feeling guilty!"
1793,"This is the only oat meal which I believe is certified to be Gluten Free.  I have been using it for last 3 years, and have been very happy with it."
1794,"they are tiny and stinky but my Bella just loves them. she will do anything for them, sit, lay jump play dead and she is only ten weeks old. in fact I put them in a glass candie jar and when she sees me reach into it she starts her tricks before i even ask. try a small bag they are great for training"
1795,"I'm purely a tea drinker, I don't like coffee at all. Twinings teas make up about half of the teas that I drink. I love to get my ""wake up"" jolt in the morning with a big cup of Irish Breakfast Tea. It's one of the most robust and flavorful teas that I've drunk. Twinings rates it as four tea leaves on their 1-5 scale, but in my opinion, it could be a 5. I usually drink it straight with a few drops of lemon juice, but occasionally, when I add a little milk and honey, the flavor still comes through.<br /><br />I've tried other brands of Irish Breakfast Tea, with mixed results, but I always come back to Twinings' version."
1796,The Newman's Own Organics Super Dark tastes really really good. My husband and I each have a square a day or if it's a difficult day I'll have 2 squares.
1797,"Those of you that think you've had the best croutons and never had Texas Toast style, you've been living a lie.  A cold hard lie.  You haven't tried *anything* until you've tried garlic & butter flavored croutons.  A pack of 12, which understandably may seem pretty darn extreme and unnecessary, will go quick the moment this heavenly, buttery flavor melts in your mouth.  I recommend buying this extraordinary deal and using 11 packs for the munchies while watching the tube, and using only 1 for salads.  You won't be able to resist the taste so it's not like these square-shaped bundles of garlic-y joy stand a chance of making it to your evening salad and spaghetti dinner anyway."
1798,Steaz energy drinks are great tasting & great for you!  Organic and natural!  And they give you that buzz in the morning!<br />I like the Orange and Berry flavors.
1799,"While I typically like the Happy baby products, I was very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately when I opened the first of six containers it smelled stale as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time. I decided to mix up a bowl but after tasting a bite, it confirmed my initial thought--it was old despite the expiration date. My guess is that I received a bum batch however, I am not willing to try it again when there are other organic cereals I have been happy with.<br /><br />I will say I was extremely pleased with Amazon's customer service. Although this item was non-returnable, they still issued a refund to me promptly."
1800,If you love milk chocolate and smooth creme then you would love this chocolate because it is just the right combination it's so smooth and delicious that you would want to spend more on these chocolates it's not to much chocolate because me myself I don't like to much chocolate and with that creme filling it just balances it out just right I reAlly do recommend to everyone to try these out.m
1801,"We've been ordering Wellness for one of our cats who was diagnosed as insulin-dependent diabetic a few months ago.  After reading many reviews on the internet, we chose Wellness chicken and Wellness turkey canned products.  This has gone well enough.  We though we'd give him a change of taste, so ordered a case of the beef & chicken canned food.  He projectile vomited it all over the kitchen.  Maybe it's the beef, but the remainder goes to the local pound where it will hopefully be appreciated."
1802,"I am totally heartbroken that Maxwell House has discontinued this product.  It is my all time favorite, and I have found nothing else on the market like it.  Instead of using water to make this, I use coffee and it is perfect!  I do not have to add any cream or Splenda (which I prefer over sugar)."
1803,"I initially thought it was mail order version of Coffee Beans and Tea Leaves, but it's not the same. Either way, since I've had placed an order, I'd gave it a try. Now, on my third bag, and no complaints really. The coffees are full of flavors and aromas. Give it a try if you're into flavored coffee."
1804,"This is fruitcake like grandma used to make, Delicious and fresh and enjoyable. I would recommend this if you like old fashined fruit cake."
1805,"I think the title of my review accurately reflects what this product should be called. The cheese has no flavor to it. I would call it orange butter, but even butter has a distinct flavor. This is no different from regular popcorn except you get orange grease on your hand as you eat it.<br /><br />If you're looking for cheese popcorn, don't get this. It has no cheese taste to it at all."
1806,Do not buy this! All it tastes of is lime and nothing will save this soup! Better to make my own that eat this crap!
1807,"I'd never heard of this sauce (or this brand) before but I found some discussion about it on the Web, so we tried it. Hands down, this is the BEST pizza sauce you can buy in a can. You can literally eat it out of the can with a spoon, it's that good. It's the only brand my family buys anymore. We've been using it for several years now on homemade pizza."
1808,I love these!  No worries about gluten!  I felt these were every bit as good as Jelly Bellies. Delicious flavors-will order again-  Only down side is they are so good it is hard to stop eating them!
1809,"Best one if you are looking for pure St John Wort Tea, all the other St John tea have other items in them hence you effects like high blood pressure get this instead it is better then a regular anti depressant and works right away"
1810,This stuff works okay in bread mixes and such.  It is rather expensive for such a small bottle though.
1811,"I had both the pepper and salt grinders and was very happy with both until they ran out and I had to throw them away. Be aware they are not refillable. I'm buying refillable grinders now so I dont have to keep buying the whole thing all the time. If you dont mind buying the grinder as well as the pepper every time then these are a good choice. Just gets expensive in the long run, especially if you cook a lot."
1812,"I ordered 6 boxes of cereal. The order is received in a well prepared Amazon package. However, all six boxes has expiration date in April, 2012 ... One of the six has part of the package teared apart"
1813,"I ordered after reading all the reviews here.First time I made, I was hooked.Now its been 2 years.<br /><br />You need the right tools/steps to get the perfect taste though.<br /><br />1.Use a Bialetti espresso maker,if you can.<br />2.Don't stuff the filter all the way up,if you are making one cup only.<br />3.If you like milk with it, I suggest shaking the milk in a bottle, till it becomes frothy(you can use a milk frother as well,but just more cleaning etc.) and then add it on top, the flavour is completely different as compared to just pouring the milk in.<br />4.Enjoy."
1814,"Good Product.  For heavy coffee drinker it is a little expensive but well worth the price if you only dring 1 or 2 cups a day, Service from vendor was splendid."
1815,"When combined with other recipes this mix is absolutely awsome. My family loves it.<br />Makes everything I bake so much lighter. I don,t have to use<br />much to make pan cakes. And my cookies are wonderful."
1816,BEST COFFEE ON THE MARKET.  HAVE IT EVERY MORNING.  REALLY LIKE THE EASE OF USE
1817,"Although the product description made this tea sound pretty wonderful, I was still skeptical, having been a serious tea drinker now for 15 years.  I'm even more skeptical of the quality of bagged teas, since many ""pyramid"" teabags still have tea leaf fannings or even dust in them, just like the old school ""flat"" tea bags.  This tea not only brews up into a hefty serving of BOP, but the taste is fresh and clean, yet complex enough to be considered a decent spring flush Darjeeling.  I was thrilled, because it can be difficult to find a good spring flush that is affordable and organic as well!  And, while I generally prefer loose tea to bagged, I can use this at work when I'm pressed for time and still enjoy what I'm drinking.  It would be great if the bags weren't stuffed into very small (albeit freshness-preserving) packages which, on my clumsier days, is hard to open without feeling like I'm smashing the leaves.  The teabag strings could be a bit longer as well.  But these are very small complaints, and they will not stop me from ordering again.  If the packaging helps to keep this tea as affordable as it is, it's a small inconvenience to put up with.<br /><br /> I am also going to try this brand's other Darjeelings--check them out!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQ8"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Autumn Flush, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OPY"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Monsoon Flush,  20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OQI"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Bags, Green, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 3)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1OP4"">Chamong Darjeeling Tea Sample Pack, 5-Count Teabags (Pack of 24)</a>"
1818,"I make a loaf of this bread mix in my bread machine at least once a week for my son who is on the GF/CF diet.  He had no hesitation in eating this bread and it allows him to continue having PB&J sandwiches.  My daughter who is not on the diet happily eats it with her brother at lunchtime so I don't have to worry about the kids sharing.  She has access to wheat bread and never complains about eating this bread.  My husband also likes the bread.  I find it to have a little of a ""beany"" taste by itself, but have enjoyed it as a base for stuffing and breadcrumbs.  It's easy to make in a bread machine and requires only milk (I use almond), eggs, oil, and cider vinegar--all staples at my house.  It's easy, almost fail-proof, and with Amazon subscription, the most cost-effective MIX I've found."
1819,Once you try these chocolates from Leonidas you will never want anything else!  I first discovered these when I lived in Belgium in the 80's and have never forgotten them.  The taste is simply incredible...melt in your mouth good.
1820,"We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!"
1821,"Served on it's own, like straight black coffee, it's great.  However, I wouldn't recommend adding creamer, milk, sugar, etc., whatever you would normally add, as it tends to take Away from the taste.  If you really have to have a sweetener of some kind, try a hazelnut creamer, as it helps make it palatable to those who need a little sweet with their coffee."
1822,"these 1/4 inch chunks of dried mushrooms pack a great deal of flavor. the photograph is not really accurate, at least for my batch--mine were more consistently sized and larger than the shreds that are depicted.<br /><br />i have bought many packages of whole porcinis at much higher prices, and the quality of these nuggets is roughly the same. the mushrooms are of good, consistent quality--i've not encountered any dark, crinkly, off-flavored pieces in the package (typical for inexpensive porcini).they've worked well in the recipes i've used them in. one complaint: i cannot seem to get all the grit out, no matter how many times i strain, sieve, soak. that's true of some much more expensive mushrooms, so not a deal killer for me. it's hardly noticeable."
1823,"I have to eat a completely gluten free diet and these fruity burst crispy bars are just great!!  I love them, they have bits of fruit in them and taste sweet & great!!  I take one as a snack with me to work almost every day.  I give these crispy bars 5 stars and will defiantly buy them again!"
1824,"I agree that this is a great product for a less expensive cheese sauce for macaroni and cheese (haven't tried it on popcorn yet), but my only gripe is that it is a bit too salty for my taste and the taste I want my children to have.  I'm just glad that it's available for a good price."
1825,"I tried this product on a whim, hoping that it would be good.<br />To my surprise, it was very good. I was pleased that the<br />ingredients did not include trans fat or high fructose corn<br />syrup. For a convenience item, I give it high marks. It tastes<br />great and is extremely easy to prepare."
1826,These protein bars are good! Similar to an actual candy bar of course more healthier. I've had many different brands of protein bars and these are the best I've had so far.
1827,"The taste is alright.  I love vanilla chai tea and I thought I would try this.  I added a lot of cream to it after it brewed and then it was more to my liking.  Next time I'm considering adding a drop of vanilla extract, I have a feeling that will do the trick."
1828,My dogs don't like this one as much as Happy Hips. Got it for their skin and coats but at least with one of my dogs there is some ingredient that causes her to scratch more. Wish Dogswell would look into what ingredient would cause an allergic reaction and make the change.
1829,"I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked."
1830,"This Hickory Smoked flavor is my favorite of the Primal Strips lot. The strips are moist, tender, unusually flavorful, and just the right size. Even my carnivorous relatives in Wisconsin took to these Strips. My only outstanding concern is that Primal Strips are manufactured in Taiwan, which  means their production is outside the domain of US food safety and inspection. However, having consumed over two dozen of these strips in the past month, I remain happy and healthy."
1831,"When I first took a bite, I seriously thought I was eating dog food.  These are disgusting.  I searched the bag for ""dog food"" and the expiration date thinking that it was bad for one of those reasons.  I don't know how anyone can like these."
1832,"These cookies taste awful - they are inedible. Taste like cardboard, dry and hard. You cannot return them because they are a food product. They might make good hockey pucks. I threw them out. This review is also for the chocolate chip cookies. I ordered those for my spouse. He said the same thing about his and we threw his out also. Word to the wise..."
1833,"I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes."
1834,"My cats don't like it. what else can I say to reach 20 words.  It was an expensive mistake.  My older cat likes the premium edge food for older cats, but she may just be eating it because that is what she gets."
1835,"If you are looking for non-wheat based treats - these are not them - the first ingredient is flour. The second is wheat meal.<br /><br />Some people are very wary of this sort of thing for their pups, so I wanted to get that out of the way. Do they clean your dog's teeth? I can't say as we brush their teeth nightly - but they are quite hard biscuits - so they have the potential - as do most other very hard treats - to help clean teeth.<br /><br />Size - small - well, really, they are on par with other medium biscuits - so if you have a toy breed - as in less than 10 lbs - they will likely have trouble with these as they are larger than most 'small' biscuits.<br /><br />The dogs love them - of course, the dogs love all treats - but they don't spit them out in disgust ;)<br /><br />Overall, they are fine - the pups have gone through most of the box so far (we have 3 and they get treats a couple times a day). No problems at all.<br /><br />If you have a 15-50lb dog - and are looking for a hard treat that might help with keeping their teeth clean, this is a good option."
1836,"I've been eating gluten free for about seven years, and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. ""low"" many times in those years. When I first discovered them, I loved all the shortbread styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter, with and without chips.<br /><br />I love them all, but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all-time favorite. It's tender, chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others, which can be a little sweet for my taste, this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two, I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self-indulgent).<br /><br />Like all the Pamela's cookies, they're a little pricey, but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found. (Likewise for the Bob's Red Mill GF bread mixes, which are also wonderful.) Thanks, Amazon, for your great selection of GF foods."
1837,"This coffee was in a ""sample"" selection when we ordered our Keurig Brewer.  It was by far our favorite!  I have ordered this coffee several times from Amazon.  It is a dark roast, but not too strong."
1838,"Love these bags, great size and not so flimsy that they fall apart when you place your composte items in it.  Great product, highly recommended."
1839,"Received this one as a gift...actually it was a gift meant to be sarcastic as the giver of this gift knows I am a bit of a health nut and avoid candy for the most part.  Joke is on her though!  I am actually a closeted candy freak.  After she left and had received my outrageously squeaks of protest, I spent a pleasing evening making a total pig of myself.<br /><br />my little container contained among other things Jr. Mints, Tootsie Rolls, (yummers), Bit o Honey, Gummy Bears (gotta love them), and my mostest favorite of all...Atomic Fireballs!  Hey, does life in candy land get any better than this!  The candy was fresh and absolutely delectable.<br /><br />On top of it all I got this nifty little can that I can use to store my little treasures in.<br /><br />This was a great gift and I can see by the price listed here that my friend got off pretty cheap!<br /><br />This is good stuff and a good buy."
1840,"If you are looking for a low calorie portable food, look no further. This can of soup tastes good and only has 280 calories (140 a serving).<br /><br />I haven't tried the regular (non healthy request) version, and I probably won't bother, considering I liked this."
1841,"I actually ordered this to act as an Easter basket for my college student. It was delivered right on time and she loved it!  The candy was packaged and decorated just like the photo, very colorful. (Popcorn is microwave and not already popped but that was actually better for us!)  I didn't order gift wrap but I did mark it as a gift and the vendor put the marked box they usually use inside a plain box so that it was a surprise.  Our order even included buttered popcorn Jelly Bellys, a favorite flavor!  I am always looking for $ 25.00-30.00 items to use as care packages. I suppose that if you added up all the great food it would be a little less than the price but the packaging is really fun and my daughter and I definitely feel that we got our money's worth.  I would be happy to order from this shop again."
1842,"We switched or dog to the canned All Ages food. She has had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days. She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog - 19 years old.<br /><br />Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.<br /><br />We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her."
1843,Ordered these for my husband and he said they are okay but he likes the Green Mountain brand better.  Next time will order the Green Mountain brand.
1844,"High quality dog food, I feed lamb as it is easier on their disgestion, I highly recommend this if you have small dogs.."
1845,"Is it possible to be in love with turkey jerky?<br /><br />If you are gluten-sensitive or celiac, this may be your chance to find out:  spicy, chewy, and appetizingly greasy, after eating these for lunch for several days, I can tell you that these are really gluten free.  And, they taste good.  This is perfect as a brown bag lunch item or as a snack to keep in your briefcase.<br /><br />Yummy."
1846,I like em but nothing unique about the flavor.  basically saves you from having to make them at home... a little pricey but for a treat what the heck
1847,"First the good - it tastes as good as Orville's (if you like Orville).  Now the bad - Eating Lady Finger is like eating popcorn crumbs.  If you are looking for popcorn you can eat without a spoon, try something else.  The popped corn is only slightly larger than the kernels."
1848,"What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!"
1849,"I grew up on Mrs. Grass in Northern Ohio. I love this soup.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00122E6S2"">Mrs. Grass Chicken Soup Mix with Extra Noodles, 6.2-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>I have been in Arkansas for 30 years. They don't sell it here. Until i discovered it on Amazon.com I had to do without or bring it back after a visit to Ohio. Not any more! Thank you Amazon"
1850,"I served these with a nice dinner -- they fluffed up well and look terrific.  But no one could stand THAT much garlic in them!  Just a hint of garlic is ok but these tasted like they were BATHED in garlic .... and they ended up in the dogs' bowls... but the dogs liked them, which didn't surprise me... since they would also eat roadkill."
1851,"I was skeptical about the combo of flavors on this one, but my dog loves them and they're a prefect size to break in half and use from training purposes."
1852,"If you like salt and vinegar crisps (chips), but would prefer the vinegar to lighter, you should love these.  Salty and slightly tangy and yummy!"
1853,This coffee is extremely bitter. You can't drink this coffee without some sort of milk or creamer (unless you prefer that sort of thing). I tried the original Gevalia coffee (non Crema brand) and it tastes better in my opinion.
1854,I have purchased these fries before---both in this flavor and the other flavors available.  They are great tasting and only have 110 calories per bag.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
1855,"My cats are real picky about trying new foods. I popped open 2 cans (1 yellowfin & 1 tuna and sole)and set down the dish.  The first cat walked over took a little nibble and then went for the full chowdown.  The second cat realized that she was missing out, pushed the older cat out of the way and set about to power eating.  2 happy cats over here.<br /><br />Happy human notes: no BIG fishy smell, no strange looking formed bits,  just some good looking, healthy cat food."
1856,"Tried these when they were on sale 2 for 1 at Safeway. I did see that the box said whole wheat; but, it also said WHOLE GRAIN (second ingredient). They were delicious! Not just salty tasting without flavor - quite tasty! I'm buying more now from Amazon because of the good S&S price. Great for snacks and with soup. Good job, Ritz!"
1857,"First of all, you can get this same item (5-13 oz cans) for less than $10 at Sam's Club, so this product is ridiculously overpriced, even if you factor in free shipping.  Secondly, as another reviewer pointed out, this chicken is extremely bland, in fact I think it is the most bland chicken imaginable.  It just tastes like nothing.  I honestly use it for dog treats.  It works great for this purpose.  For some reason my dogs will not eat specially made ""dog treats"", no matter what kind I try to use.  This stuff though is bland and lean enough that it works great as a dog treat."
1858,"My dog loves this treat/dental cleaner. Her teeth were cleaned noticeabley within 2 weeks.  We like the ingredients and it's made in the USA.  Costco used to supply the item, but no longer.  Great product."
1859,these are the best. made from a caring company- never seen these on a recall list!!!!<br />love the size but know some say they r too large for the smaller dog however they have heard these requests and now there are smaller sizes too!!!<br />will never buy anything else-
1860,"I found this really offers a crunchy snack for me while doing the no carb diet.  However, I find I can make my own from shredded paremsan, almost as good!"
1861,I love chocolate cereal and I love Cap'N'Crunch so I was excited to try this. Gag me. It's awful. I don't know who taste tested this before it came out but they apparently arent familiar with the taste of chocolate. I dont know what this taste is?! I would like to give no stars.
1862,"Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time."
1863,"I tried this yeast for cider on the recommendation that it would produce a dry, beerlike English-style cider. I have started two batches so far. In batch 1, the yeast hydrated in water and started a good ferment in the carboy after about a day and a quarter. Activity was as expected for all 2 1/2 weeks of the first ferment. It's racked and aging now, but the taste is already very promising- quite like beer, with plenty of apple notes that the yeast does not overwhelm. I would expect that properly aged the result will indeed be pretty English.<br /><br />Batch 2 I hydrated in the actual juice (reserved from the main stock). You aren't supposed to do this but I wanted to keep my volume of liquid down and my taste undiluted. Low and behold, I got bubbles even faster, in only about 12 hours. VERY impressed.<br /><br />If you use this yeast for cider remember that apple juice/soft cider is nutritionally incomplete for beer yeasts; you should feed it with some yeast nutrient (available on Amazon as well) and some sugar (I use Woodstock organic brown).<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I have completed 2 batches of cider using Nottingham. Results were very good; all sulphery notes during ferment disappeared fairly quickly and the yeast did not impart a yeasty taste to the finished brews. One thing I have noticed is that in both cases, getting the yeast to perk back up for bottle carbonation took a pretty long time- it seems like in an alcohol-rich environment Nottingham dies or goes dormant pretty fast, which probably makes it a good candidate for cold crashing.<br /><br />I will definitely use this yeast again for the great taste and consistent results it produces."
1864,"We love these bags and use them daily for our 2 large-breed dogs. They are roomy enough to hold both of their waste on the same walk. The bags have pre-cut holes in the top so you can slide one of the bag through a hole and it seals without messing with tying it, which is super helpful with 2 dogs pulling you along for a walk. Can also clip the bag via the hole onto their harness for long walks where there isn't a trash can so you don't have to carry/smell the waste. Best part is it's biodegradable and compostable."
1865,I didn't realize this was so big until I got it.  I ended giving it to my Fiance's mom for her GSD.
1866,"Good god, that's a terrifying ingredients list! Try McCormick's instead; low sodium variety tastes just as good as the old school Old El Paso stuff."
1867,"I've been a happy Canidae customer for over a year, recommending the product to everyone.  However, they have recently changed the formula and my dog has been violently ill.  I've talked to most of the suppliers of Canidae in the Chicago area, and they are receiving countless complaints about very sick dogs since the new formula was introduced.<br />I'm taking my dog off of this food immediately.  He's been sensitive to different foods in the past, but never as violently as this.<br />It's disturbing that they would make this switch without notification.  At least I finally know what's wrong with my dog, and that it's been happening to countless others.  Beware."
1868,"I'm a health nut so I love cooking with EVOO or eat it raw with rye bread. It's great for both your insides and outsides. I could go on and on about the good things evoo is but I must state that I have acne prone skin and literally tried everything on the market. I used evoo and a little bit of lemon juice as a moisturizer, a simple soap free cleanser, and my skin has improved so much! Who knew the most simple things can be lifesavers, especially on my wallet. :D"
1869,"As a diabetic, I am always looking for sugar free products that don't taste like garbage.  As an ex-New Yorker, And one who was raised on chocolate egg creams, the lack of a good chocolate syrup has been a long search.  This isn't perfect, but it is the very best out there."
1870,"I love the candy bar, Big Hunk, but it is so much better to just have a little at a time. It is so good to have just a taste and be able to carry them in my purse for later. These were very fresh. The shipping time was amazing. I had them in time to surprise my sister for her birthday."
1871,"This is a great blend for those who do not like just the brown rice by itself. It is also tasty when you cook it with salt and butter. I've also tried adding dried cranberries and peanuts to give it a different flavor...yummy! It is a healthier alternative over the regular white rice. Although it is pricier than regular white rice, buying it from Amazon in bulk reduces the cost per container. I've seen it in the standard markets for over $7 each. My only gripe about cooking brown rice is that it takes longer to cook than regular white rice. However, I do recommend this mix to anyone looking for a healthier way to eat!"
1872,"I do not usually eat sweets, as I find most American made desserts too sweet for me. However, these cookies are just so delicious that I cannot put them down! I love how the frosting is not just sugar, but also has a butter cream vanilla taste. It tastes like cake. The sprinkles add just the right amount of crunchiness before you bite into the entire cookie. As you chew, the cookie turns into a mouth watering sweet buttery cake dough. This is why I need to watch myself and count the cookies as I eat, to prevent over eating! Though they all taste the same, I am personally more attracted to the pink ones =) So glad I can get these cookies at Wal-mart!<br />I do not recommend buying this online, just because when it gets hot, the cookies tend to stick together. It is annoying having a double-cookie because they will not separate without breaking. Also, always store in a cookie place! Enjoy your cookies =) Thanks for reading!"
1873,"I thought I wasn't going to like this soda. Boy was I wrong! This soda has a delicious cherry-candy-ish flavor, like a cherry tootsie pop or a sour cherry gel candy. Plus, it's pretty healthy, since it doesn't contain Splenda, aspartame, phosphoric acid, or caramel color."
1874,"My best friend got me into chai, and this is some of the best I've come across. Big Train makes all kinds of flavors, but I've tried several and the raspberry is my personal favorite. The powder makes a flavorful, milky hot drink that's easier on my stomach than coffee, and tastes better than most coffee I've ever had, too!"
1875,"WONDERFUL PINK PEPPERMINT FUDGE<br /><br />4 1/2 cups sugar<br />1 stick of butter<br />1 can evaporated milk<br />Mix the above ingredients and cook EXACTLY 5 1/2 minutes<br />Remove from heat and VERY QUICKLY add<br />2 pkgs Peppermint Crunch Chips<br />1 70z jar marshmallow creme<br />1 teas.vanilla<br />Stir until smooth and pour into a greased pan. Let cool and Cut into aprox. 1"" pieces<br /><br />Makes great peppermint fudge!<br />Since the chips are seasonal, stock up for the year! I bought 24 bags!"
1876,"This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices."
1877,"I've been feeding my two labradors this food for about 3 yrs now and they are both doing well.<br />My older lab (13yrs.) seems to thrive on it and despite some level of arthritis in her hips, she still is very active. I don't mean to ascribe this to Canidae soley, but it certainly helps."
1878,"These chips are delicious. Salty sweet with a hint of spice. I have no idea how Tamari is supposed to taste, but these chips are awesome. I just finished an entire bag in one day!"
1879,"I first had Carnation Instant Breakfast as a snack when I was a kid, and now my kids love it too. We usually get Chocolate, because it is cheaper (about $10 for a 30-pack at Costco), but we prefer Vanilla (we like vanilla milkshakes better than chocolate too). $30 for this pack of 60 is not a bad price considering how much it is at the store--you might be able to find it cheaper sometimes on sale and/or with a coupon, but Amazon is so convenient that I decided to stock up.<br /><br />I love this, because it is great as breakfast on the run (my teen has it almost every day) or a yummy but healthy snack for the kids--or ME! The kids feel like they're getting a treat and I feel like they're getting vitamins!!! Sometimes I drink this instead of grabbing something from the candy bowl--tastes great and I don't feel guilty! It's a great alternative to pre-mixed chocolate milk too.<br /><br />Now if only Amazon would put this on subscribe and save... :)"
1880,"No, this stuff doesn't beat boiling chicken carcasses, but it comes pretty close. Regular chicken bouillon can't compare. Mix this stuff with chicken breast, noodles, vegetables, and spices and you get a very good chicken soup. A crock pot/slow cooker really shines on this kind of dish.<br /><br />The problem: I live in Hawaii, one of the most expensive parts of the country. The most expensive grocery store sells this for 6.59. I buy it for 4.79. Usually Amazon shines on this kind of thing, but not with the Better than Bouillon series."
1881,"This was great Lavender!  My entire room, smelled of wonderful lavender, as soon as I opened the box!  The color was beautiful and the bundles were very large.  I have ordered Lavender several times before from other companies, and the bundles I received were never as large as this!  Also, be aware that I have previously purchased Lavender (which had been ordered, from other rather large companies,) and it was old and smelled moldy upon receipt.  From now on I will only order Lavender from this seller!"
1882,"Once I tasted Hazelnut coffee, I was hooked! Now it's the only coffee I drink. Maxwell House Hazelnut is my favorite brand, but it has been hard to find sometimes in stores. Until we can order it on Amazon, try either Don Francisco's Hazelnut or even Target's Market Pantry Hazelnut Brand - both are very good."
1883,"Haven't had a really good curry ketchup for 20 years. Even thogh it may cost more than some other curry ketchups,it is worth it. Will have to put this on automatic reorder. It was also shipped really fast from order time."
1884,I have been waiting for the Chicken flavor be added as a subscribe and save option and was excited to order - only to be sent BEEF. I complained and Amazon offered to send again. When I looked at the confirmation email (and the listing) the jpeg photo is CLEARLY For BEEF and the ingredients say beef - but the TITLE is CHICKEN.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they thanked me for noticing the issue with the page -yet - as of today - the error is still not fixed.  Be sure not to order from this listing until the product image and product description match the product title.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00487VX2U/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details
1885,"I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.<br /><br />IF YOU WANT A HEALTHY PET AND A FEW BUCKS SAVED FROM A VET VISIT, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS FOOD!"
1886,I like bold coffee and usually drink Starbucks when I'm out and various Bold varieties that are available for my Keurig Coffee Maker when I'm home.  But - I had quit drinking coffee in the evenings because of restless sleep if I drank it too close to bedtime.  I can drink this right up to bed time and sleep without problem - AND - it tastes GREAT!<br /><br />Good job Emeril.
1887,"I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once."
1888,"The packets of white hot chocolate powder mix have been discontinued by Timothy's (per their customer service) so I purchased the K-cups this time around from Amazon for the great quantity and price deal.  Well, let me tell you, the K-cup formula tastes like chemicals and has a lousy aftertaste. They are horrible. The label on the box of K-cups says there is sucralose in them whereas the packets did not have sucralose. I still had one packet left to compare labels with and that is the main difference. I called Timothy's customer service to ask why they changed the formula & did I get a box of ""sugar-free"" or ""diet"" K-cups in a regular box in error. I was informed this is just the way they're formulated.  So, I will never buy them again & will have to find someone to take these 2 boxes of nasty tasting things off my hands."
1889,"These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great."
1890,"Pros - good price for its size, fast delivery,<br />Con - not the best tasting jimmies, still better than getting the small grocery store size"
1891,Absolutely love Wolfgang Puck Rodeo Drive K Cups.  It is the best.  Nice rich flavor but not too strong.  Best one yet!
1892,"I love this stuff. I use so much of this stuff I have to buy the 32 oz jug. It dissolves easier in fluid than just the powder. I also use their extract. Between these two products and my raw vanilla bean powder, I eat vanilla like it's a food group.<br /><br />I've had some other vanilla bean pastes. They were okay. This one's the bomb."
1893,I have loved this coffee for over 12 years.  So glad to find it online.  Not in stores in Maryland.
1894,"This is the best rub i have found or even made. No need to drive yourself crazy trying to perfect your own rub, they have done it for you.<br />With butts and whole chickens/turkeys it is great. On ribs go very sparingly, it can overwhelm them! I also like to melt this in water/applejuice/vinegar/butter and inject it directly into the butts (10 to 12LBS typically). I like the keep the butts in the ""shrinkwrap"" they come in from BJ's overnite then put the rub on at least 4-6 hours prior letting the meat come up to room temp in a bag till it is soaked in then i add another sprinkling. I got a ""pizza"" shaker type metal shaker that makes the application easy and it works out great. I slow smoke often and 1 gallon of this lasts me right around a year but I use it for everything! Really is worth the money, you will not regret it, just go easy on the ribs as it is a bit salty ad full flavored."
1895,"This all-natural product is effective in taking the edge off the anxiety of separation, road trips, or vet visits. Dogs beg for this tasty treat. Who could ask for anything more?"
1896,"Before I used this product it hurt to type, not physicly but mentaly. I worried was I good enough to type? After drinking Kombucha for one week  I feel nothing, I am now mentaly pain free. I use to think twice about offering up my review on a product. With Kombucha in my belly I type away on reviews feeling no pain, in fact I feel nothing in my head.<br />Thank you Kombucha!"
1897,"I received the order in a timely fashion and got the most recent manufactured date (so no...it was not stale).  Would do business with anyone who carries the NOW Label.  Haven't taken it long enough to give it my review, but will at a later date."
1898,"The original box caught my attention while I was tea shopping at the always busy Fairway on Broadway. Price wise this was almost double of what all the other teas were but I couldn't resist the temptation of a new tea. It was a good choice in the end and I can't wait to try all the flavors this brand carries.<br /><br />The mesh tea bag crinkles and sloshes like an expensive fabric as this single origin full leaf tea blooms once the water hits it. This tastes and looks like expensive loose tea with long graceful leaves that always remind me of seaweed in cold green sea. The taste is absolutely exquisite due to the single origin or pure Assam tea, meaning that small and delicate blossoms are selected with no fillers and cheap mixes to stretch the quantity of tea the company can package and sell. This tastes lovely on its own or is incredibly creamy and quiet dreamy with a splash of milk and always with sugar. For connoisseurs of plain black tea, this taste will soothe the taste buds and this will be something that they will reach for daily. I can't even recall how many times I pick this tea over coffee in the morning to give me will to live!<br /><br />- Kasia S."
1899,Bought these for my 15 month old and I will NEVER go back to the Gerber cereal bars.<br /><br />These have more nutritional value and cost less.<br /><br />The only down side is it's hard to get him to eat just one.  It finishes so quickly he begs for more.  I wish they made a slightly bigger size for bigger kids<br /><br />Great product!
1900,"We haven't opened the jar yet, but the label gives more information than the company's web site does. Water is listed as the first ingredient, then ""smoked herring 40%,"" followed by cuttlefish, salt, potato starch, and other ingredients. It would be useful if the online descriptions were at least as clear as the labels."
1901,"I like strong coffee and usually dislike the pre-measured pods, etc. because the result is a lame brew. But ""Jet Fuel"" is excellent, though I only brew cup size, not mug. I received the Keurig as a gift along with many samples; Jet Fuel was not among them but I figured with a name like that, it might be pretty hearty and it was. I just wish it were more readily available."
1902,"I always buy the chicken flavor that walmart sells for around $6, so when I saw this BREATH one for about the same price, I was very happy (both of our large dogs love to get up close and personal!). However when it came, it was pepperoni flavor instead of fresh breath- the exact opposite!! :-O  However, the dogs still enjoyed it, although I won't order it online again since its a little bit cheaper at walmart- and I can be sure to get the right flavor!<br /><br />However, overall this Kong filler is awesome to keep our 2 large dogs entertained for a little while during the day- and they love it!"
1903,"I think BJs has a better deal on mixed fruit packs by Gerber, but if your child really loves peaches, this is great!"
1904,My dogs love the Busy Buddy Gnawhide bones.  The bones keep them occupied and happy for a while when I'm busy and can't give them the attention they want.
1905,"I've been drinking different types of protein powders for a long time now.  This one I would have to rate the best because it's raw, organic and has alot of fiber in it.  Here's the deal:  The serving size is 4 tablespoons and you get 14 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein, 1 g sugar, a small percentage of Calcium, Vitamin E and Iron, 48% Magnesium, and 22% Zinc.  So with all that said, I use only 1 tablespoon per smoothie shake (banannna, frozen strawberries, dash of organic vanilla) all in the blender and I can't even taste the hemp.  I do this three times a day and I am in heaven because I am actually drinking something healthy and not so processed like other protein powders.  This hemp also has a full amino acid profile.  You can't go wrong with this.  If you are looking for a protein powder with a very high amount of protein in it, then the isolated (processed) kinds will have more, but in my opinion your body can't handle all that protein at once and plus the processed varieties are not good for you anyway.  Just take it easy and enjoy the best of the best, rather than overload on highly processed protein powders."
1906,"*Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet. THANK YOU SO MUCH!<br /><br />Now on to my review...<br /><br />My cat has been slowly switching to Newman's own beef products over from Wellness brand cat food (which is a great brand and will still be reserved for treats occasionally). I was ecstatic that there was a totally NO grain-and-NO fillers ORGANIC cat food I could feed my 9 year old cat who is prone to crystal formation in his bladder and also plaque build up on his teeth (even though I brush his outer teeth every evening).<br /><br />So far I've tried the beef & Liver and the Liver and he LOVES it. I just ordered the beef today for him which I'm sure he'll love too.<br /><br />This product *IS* very thick and concentrated (the beef liver alone has the consistency of a concentrated pate' and the beef & liver has the consistency of a gelatinous, thick beefy oatmeal), so I scoop it into his bowl and blend a bit of hot water to the product to warm the fats and make more of a 'gravy' for him (he also prefers to eat his food a bit warm anyhow). He barely wants to nibble at his Wellness brand cat food now (which I've had him on for over four years, so I guess that means he's one 'sold' cat. It might be unusual for a cat to love beef so much but my cat goes crazy for beef (especially if I make him steak when I can afford to). So, for me to find him a organic, no grain, beef based line of cat food made his day (and one of his nine lives no doubt)!<br /><br />Anyway, if you know your cat already loves beef and beef liver then he/she will probably be just peachy keen with this product.<br /><br />Here is the ingredients list for Newman's own canned beef cat products:<br /><br />Beef:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................12.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................4.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/3oz can)...........156<br /><br />Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef Liver, Organic Liver Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................11.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................2.5% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................83.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.5% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........129<br /><br />Beef & Liver:<br /><br />Organic Beef, Organic Beef Liver, Organic Beef Broth, Minerals (Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Proteinate, Iron Carbonate, Copper Proteinate, Manganese Iodate, Calcium Iodate, Sodium Selenite), Taurine, Vitamins (Vitamin A, E, E, D3, B12 and K Supplements, Choline, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Riboflavin, Thiamine, Pyridoxine, Folic Acid, Biotin).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein..................10.0% (min)<br />Crude Fat.........................3.0% (min)<br />Crude Fiber......................1.0% (max)<br />Moisture.........................82.0% (max)<br />Ash.................................1.0% (max)<br />Magnesium.....................0.02% (max)<br />Taurine..........................0.07% (min)<br /><br />CALORIC VALUE:<br /><br />As fed (Kcal/12oz can)...........140<br /><br />Here's to Kitty's health!"
1907,"We've had a Keurig Coffee maker in our office for a couple of years now and I've enjoyed it immensely. I've probably tried every offering that has been available in the office, including regular caffeinated coffees. By far the most flavorful is Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf. While I do tend to favor decaf, this one stands out to me among them all. One of the favorites in the office is Timothy's Rainforest Espresso which is good in it's own right, however, after we ran out of Emeril's I was forced to brew myself a cup of Rainforest and was left disappointed in the taste department. Other reviewers may call the taste burnt, but to my palate it is robust, flavorful and thoroughly enjoyable coffee."
1908,"The best K-Cups I have tried so far.  Others have said they like Newman's Own, but that this Starbucks Dark French Roast is better and I have to agree.  A bit stronger than Newman's.  I just purchased this 54 pack, but I have already went through a couple of 12 packs (not beer :-) .  I also recommend the TAZO Green Tea."
1909,"Twinings' line of cold brewed teas is one of the best products out there that doesn't compromise taste for convenience!  I am a long-time tea drinker, loving all forms, customs and fashion of drinking the divine beverage.  I love green teas both hot and cold; I place one of these lovely bags into my large see-through travel cup, fill 'er up with ice and add water.  By the time I get to work I start sipping.  Although this is enjoyed best in our California summers, I admit I drink it year-'round.  Ordering in bulk through Amazon is the most cost-effective way to enjoy this drink.  Such loveliness!"
1910,"I got this and wanted to try it out and the price was right!  Wow - the taste is sub-par and does taste like something you would find at a gas station dispenser!<br /><br />When I was reading the nutrition facts I noticed that it had 80 calories per serving (not a big deal), I then scanned down and saw that it has 23% of your daily saturated fat!!  Wow!  When I read through the ingredient list the first ones are: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, sugar, corn syrup solids, and then instant coffee and some others.  I'm not health nut both those things don't sound that healthy to me and I can see where the saturated fat is coming from!"
1911,This is a great product.  I drink this tea for medical reasons and seems to help my problem.  It was recommended by a friend and will continue to drink this great product.
1912,"For 100 calories, these brownies are quite good.  I find keeping them in the freezer or refrigerator makes them better and last longer."
1913,"I love the idea of the drawer that you can put the brewer on top of, but this thing is really lousy. The pods keep getting stuck so it becomes impossible to open/close the drawer. All of the pods fall over every time you do manage to get it open so it just ends up being a big mess.  Huge disappointment!"
1914,"Have you wondered (or are you still wondering) why the hotel's waffle mix tastes so good, and it seems like you have a hard time replicating the recipe with the waffle mix you got from the grocery stores ?<br /><br />Well, I have and it was baffling! I didn't give up on my wish to be able to make the YUMMIEST waffle at my own kitchen.<br />I went to Amazon.com and encountered this product ""Golden Malted"" Waffle mix. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL60W"">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />At first, I was hesitant, especially after seeing that it only comes in a pack of 3 -- ""I still have those 'failed' old waffle flours in the kitchen, why would I buy 3 to simply try? ""<br /><br />After extensive reviews both on amazon and google, I decided to try it as a lot of people gave it good ratings and agreed that it tastes like the hotel's waffle mix.<br /><br />The result ? OMG, the waffle was mouth-watering. I followed the recipe written: Mix waffle flour + eggs + some water + butter.<br />Using a Belgian waffle maker, cooking was about 5 min. The aroma was just heavenly. I paired it with ""Grade B - dark amber"" Real Mapple Syrup <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a>. (Yes, there are imitation waffle syrup out there!) It was really the YUMMIEST waffle I ever made -- crispy on the outside, moist in the inside and it's not heavy (like pancakes)<br /><br />I have been buying this waffle mix and truly recommend it to those who have been in 'the hunt of the perfect waffle mix'<br /><br />They have the ""all natural"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO6BFE"">Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)</a> and ""blueberry flavored"" <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042RNHVG"">Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Blueberry, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a>. I have not tried these. And, I think I am staying with the ""original"".<br /><br />Enjoy !"
1915,"The health benefits are uncertain, but this is a nice variant of another favorite, Celestial Seasonings' Cranberry Apple Zinger. The Alvita tea is tart, light, and refreshing - and Alvita has a long history making healthful products that are also surprisingly good values."
1916,"Excellent product, received promptly and fresh when opened. However, I found it was priced about the same as in Walmart. I expected more of a price bargain when ordering in bulk."
1917,This brand of kombucha was really great! love the individual cans; easy to pack and go. Just put in my 3rd orderfew days ago. Will recommend this to anyone. JUst wish it was a bit cheaper.
1918,"Just like the previous reviewer, the first thing I scanned wjth this new app was the (in my case, 18 ounce) box of Rice Krispies in front of me on the breakfast table. And, just like the previous reviewer's, the results I received were inaccurate: ""Community 12-pack"" (at a much higher price than we'd paid). I'll update my review once I've scanned and checked a few more products, but so far, I'm not as ""wowed"" as I have been with previous buys from these guys. ...P. S. - After writing all of the above, but before hitting the 2nd round of ""Publish Review"" buttons, I discovered that the result info had changed! Now, it's telling me that my 18 ounce box is only a 4-pack of boxes, instead of either the 12-pack it had originally said, or the individual package it actually is! (V-e-r-r-r-y interesting...)"
1919,"They LOVE it, I give my kitties (Silki and Tuffy) half a pouch each as a mid day snack to keep thier bird terrorizing energy level up.I gave it 4 stars only because it's a little messy to tear open sometimes, and I don't use scissors because you have to clean them afterwards. Oh Well, they DO love it."
1920,Excellent flavor and ease of use.  Product is as close to brewed Tea as I have ever tasted.
1921,"good tasting pasta for a gluten free lifestyle. But it is very expensive, I don't understand why Gluten free food is so expensive"
1922,"I pretty much only drink black tea. Other than the occasional mineral water, I drink nothing else. I love black teas and the stronger the better. For those like myself, you will find this version of Earl Grey mild and pleasant. I don't find this tea bitter at all, no matter how long I let the tea bag steep for. If anything I find it even milder than other common brands of Earl Grey, like Bigelow and Tazo. The bergamot is not overpowering at all and I find this even makes for a great to to go with meals because of the mild flavors.<br /><br />After drinking almost the entire box, I rate this as definitely one to order more of. It's a great way to introduce someone to Earl Grey who may not be accustomed to the bold flavors of the blend. It's also a great blend for those who like Earl Grey, but who sometimes find the flavor bitter or too strong. Probably one of the mildest blends I have ever had.<br /><br />No issues with the tea bags releasing any tea leaves into the cup and it makes a nice clear drink, with no cloudiness. No powdery residue left behind and no bitter after taste. This Higgins and Burke blend is delicious and goes really well with an meal."
1923,My son likes this pretty well and I like that it introduces some flavors not found in typical baby foods. High quality.
1924,"I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side."
1925,"I received these Best Buddy Bits for my dog about 6 weeks ago - and she absolutely loves them.  At 12 years of age, she is far from training age where I could use these as training treats, but historically, she has loved chicken flavored treats more than any other flavor of treats.  That is why I bought these treats, and she has loved me for it from day one.  She has a habit of prancing on her hind legs over to me when I get out her treats and she hears the bags crinkling.  However, with these treats she runs towards me and starts standing on her hind legs so excited to get these treats.  I have never seen her so excited to get a treat in her 12 years with me.  I think that goes to the quality of the treats, and to her love of her master when I give her these treats. LoL.<br /><br />My dog is a small Rottweiler at about 65 pounds.  However, that is big enough that I have to give her about 20-25 bits each time I give her these treats.  Times three times a day, that is a lot of treats.  I am certainly glad I purchased four bags of these Best Buddy Bits.<br /><br />I will have to tell you that until I received my shipment from Amazon, for some reason, I thought these treats were named Best Buddy BITES.  I do not know how I made such a blunder.  Imagine my embarrassment (in front of my dog since she was the only one around) when I realized that I had been wrong this entire time. Oh well, at least I am certainly straight on the name now!<br /><br />One last item, the Crude Fat (min) level of these treats is 13%, it is a bit more than I usually like to give my dog, but I will overlook it on these treats because she absolutely goes bonkers for these treats.  The things I do for my dog."
1926,i really like this protein butter. i put it n my Crock Pot Chili; just delicious. i put it on my toasted bagle with some jiffy peanut butter. Also delicious. i love culinary art & spices. This is a fun one. NJoy
1927,"It was fun to share a candy from my childhood with my seven year old daughter. We enjoyed them very much, especially the apple flavor!"
1928,"I was first introduced to this delicious tea in Stash's Green Tea Sampler (also highly recommended). I was immediately addicted. I really wasn't expecting to be impressed, because I usually HATE fruity teas (they always taste medicinal to me), but this is nothing like I've tasted before.<br /><br />It has an incredibly strong peach flavor and aroma, and a spicy ginger aftertaste. I can't really taste the green tea, but that's not a bad thing.<br /><br />This is one of the only teas that I put honey in, and I find that copious amounts of it make this tea the best."
1929,"The pumpkin is delicious.  I have a scoop of pumpkin in my morning smoothie.  I open a can, put it in the fridge and use it throughout the week in smoothies, soups and sauces.  Pumpkin deserves to be used in things other than just pies and bread.<br />I don't know if the packaging is different now, but none of my cans are damaged."
1930,"Similac sensative agrees with my baby 100% and ready-to-feed agrees with me!! I always have a supply in the baby bag for trips to the grocery store, a visit to grandmas and the out of blue hungry in the car. Just buy the throw away nipples and you are set.<br /><br />My baby eats 6 oz at a time so at times I just pour the formula in a bottle and cap the rest in the fridge (good up to 48 hours when opened). No need to waste the extra 2 oz.<br /><br />I do recommend buying at the grocery store. I get these for $9.00 at HEB Plus."
1931,"This product is the perfect way to end my breakfast and linger over Suduko.  I try not to drink anything with caffein because it keeps me awake all night.  In addition, I am very concerned about calories.  This is a wonderfully tasting treat which is very low in calories.  But it is too good to be true.  The first ingredient is a partially hydrogenated oil which makes it not such a good choice.  It is the only thing that I use with partially hadrogenated oil so I have one cup a day.  If it was made without the oil, I would use it all day long.  Maybe they can remove the ingredient. The flavor is marvelous.  It mixes a little slowly, but don't give up because eventually it all dissolves."
1932,"I use a lot of red food coloring & was tired of little bottles for big prices at the grocery store. It is a good buy & I would recommend it for anyone that needs a lot of food coloring for cakes, crafts, hummingbirds etc."
1933,"I've tried a number of protein bars or low carb type, and would have to say that these were the least enjoyed.  In fact, the taste did so little for me (not to mention aftertaste), that I pitched the last four.  I hate wasting food, or anything for that matter, but the alternative was to let them go stale in the pantry.  The texture was decent, but taste -- ugh -- waste of calories."
1934,"Great product.  I was looking for a way to use my coffee in my krueig machine (by cuisinart) with out having to use the supplied filter.  Let's face it, the whole point is to make a cup of coffee using the k-cup and not have to fill the little filter, then clean it afterwards.  Kinda defeats the purpose.  I was looking for this type of item and hoping that I could pre-package my brand of coffee. I was skeptical at first, but thought for the price, I'd give it a try AND the product works GREAT.  I fill up the 50 cups with the filter, lid and store it in an old K-cup box.  The lids fit tight and it works just like the more expensive k-cups. The only issue is that on my 12 cup setting, there is a little spill over, but there are no problems with the 10 cup setting.  Once in a while when you open the top to put in another cup, it will stick to the top of the machine where the hole punctures the cup, but that's in once in a while.  In fact I am about to purchase again.  I only wish the shipping wasn't as much as the product.  It arrived earlier than scheduled I believe. All in all, I will be using these on a regular basis."
1935,"That's what you'll be thinking when your nose ignites after eating a handful of this stuff. If you bungee jump, parachute, mountain bike or just love exciting and adventurous things. This stuff may be for you!"
1936,These are the only chocolate-covered pretzels i've had and will be the only ones I will ever taste. These are the best snack treats around. You just can't eat one bag!
1937,"I ordered these red only M&Ms to make an M&M cake for a baby shower, and I still have not received them more than 3 weeks later. The shower has already passed, so I ended up having to buy 20 bags of M&Ms to get the amount of red ones that I needed. It is not a very popular color in the mixed bags. The seller states that the order is on the way, and therefore, I cannot cancel it. Now I am stuck with a ton of multi-colored M&Ms and a maybe a bag of red ones and I had to pay $20 in addition to the $10 that I originally paid. Overall, this experience was horrible, due to the extremely slow shipping. Also, when I ordered the M&Ms, it said that they would be delivered in 5-7 business days, and I never received a notice that they were out of stock or on back order."
1938,"I am very happy with Cytomax.  I typically swim ten miles a week and hence focus a lot on my rehydration and electrolyte replacement, Cytomax meets those needs perfectly.  I mix up 32 ounces for a typical workout drinking about half before and rest after.  It is sweet and tasty but not sugary like Gatorade which I found did not meet my needs.  Great product and haven't found it cheaper anywhere else."
1939,I have not personally seen this product<br /> but have given it to very discerning couple<br />-as a thank you.<br />I have had rave reviews-<br />and I rather imagine these people have seen many lovely gifts-and probably don't really need anything.<br />So- I feel this is a gift I will purchase for others and feel confident in so doing!
1940,I wanted to try this because I knew this product is sold in Canada which is where i will be moving back to.. And i am very happy with it.. My cat loves it.. and i know it is good for him.. So i would purchase this for him over anything else.. I wish they would also come up with wet cat food too..
1941,I really enjoy the oatmeal and frequently share a batch with co-workers. Add dried fruit & nuts while making the crock pot version... It is easy and doesn't have to be watched & stirred.  Several co-workers are now purchasing McCann's and I often give a can as a healthy gift!
1942,"This is a great product and it is the exact same brand I grew up drinking in Germany. The only reason I give this otherwise amazing drink 3 stars is due to its price. This is more of a treat for me when I'm really home sick, and when I order them I tend to make them last and savor the flavor. German Deli has another brand that is pretty good, doesn't touch Karamalz though, and you can get 14 for roughly the same price if you're willing to settle for a lesser quality. I really wish it was easier to get in the States, because whenever I go home to germany I easily drink a crate of 20 in two weeks."
1943,The chips were fresh and shipped safely all the way to Afghanistan and quickly. I would definately order these chips again when I finish the others.
1944,"I have used ""spike"" for >20 years!! It,s best on all veggies, taken the place of smoked meats, butter, and on baked potatoes spike and a little margarine is all you need. In soups, especially vegetable soup; spike is the  bomb! I used to get this seasoning at organic/vitamin stores, but now I can buy at amazon in 6 packs."
1945,"This stuff is FANTASTIC.  Throw salmon in skillet, sprinkle some of this on, and voila!  Most delicious home-cooked salmon you'll ever have, no sauce necessary."
1946,"The tea bags make a very nice raspberry flavored tea, however there is a lingering flavor that reminds me of a slightly fermented older tea.  While nice red color and raspberry flavor, do not make stronger than recommendation of 1 tea bag per gallon.  Will not buy again do to the fermented taste."
1947,"my husband and I have been looking for a syrup to match the latte's that we purchase while out, to make at home without all the calories, additives and preservatives.  This is the best flavor and we just love it in our coffee.  we add the syrup along with our skim milk in our frother and it just turns out amazing!!!!  Definately recommend!!!"
1948,"I decided to buy these to reduce the possibilities of having high cholesterol on my next blood test from my annual exam. I eat 5 per day.  The taste is great although I get a slick feel in my mouth after eating them, but it is not annoying. These are soft chews and similar in texture and taste to a caramel. I recommend them."
1949,"I only used two maybe three tea bags and got pregnant - can not drink during pregnancy.  Not a bad taste, but I'm not a big tea fan either."
1950,"Even though I write reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil - 4 oz. - EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil - 4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI"">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16-Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0-Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full-spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, ""nutrition"" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of ""yummy."").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to ""gourmet it"" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As ""rice"" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with ""noodle heaven""; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As ""oatmeal"" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, creme, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid ( water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa.<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12-15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than ""outside-the-waves"" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8 -16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (½) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate ""lid""; zap it for another minute or half, then let it ""steep"" in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate ""lid"" I can just place it on the table for family style ""digging in.""<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Arrowhead Mills, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelinas have been added to my list of  purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much. (I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an iteresting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />--  The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varment's, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the ""naked"" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise-old-grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eons-younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre-washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000-foot-elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of ""health""?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had ""lived"" long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O"">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books, including:<br />Molasses Moon"
1951,"Within two weeks of using Schultz African Violet Plant Food my violets are producing gorgeous abundant blooms, which are notably larger and richer in color.  I highly recommend it. A tip:  Water your violets approximately every other day and never let them stand in water.  Better to let them get little dry than to over water.  And they will flourish on a window sill with the proper light."
1952,"The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the ""bricks & mortar"" stores; and I plan to order another box.  We received the product a few days after placing the order.<br /><br />Terrific product, and our lab loves this treat!"
1953,It's a great portable & healthy alternative to cookies & chips for our kids especially handy when traveling.  Just wish they can make the packaging recyclable.
1954,"This was bought as a Christmas gift.  It arrived well packaged and the gift was well received.  Hershey Chocolate Kisses are just that, the wrapping was Christmas like."
1955,Great product - super secure packaging.  Would purchase from this seller again.  Peppercorns price was less than other sites I visited.  I am very satisfied. Thank You very much!  Abby
1956,"tastes disgusting; when you bite into it, there's a great chance you could be biting into a chunk of fat..I tried the sweet and spicy and hickory, and they both had the same outcome..go elsewhere for some quality beef jerky!"
1957,"Another way to cook with the paste is to make it like a paella. Using a large skillet with a cover, you can saute veggies (e.g., onions, garlic, red pepper, celery, carrots or any combo thereof), add in some boneless chicken breast (or fish) cut bite-size. Then add in the paste and stir to spread it, and possibly some canned diced tomatoes. Add rice with enough water to cook it. Basmati works well. Stir occasionally to spread the mixture evenly and so the rice doesn't stick and you'll have a wonderful dish!"
1958,"My daughter-in-law is making most of my grandson's foods from scratch but, as a working mom, sometimes convenience is a lifesaver.<br /><br />When looking for convenience food, we choose organic foods with no unnecessary fillers or sweeteners.  However, greens can be a bit stout for a six month old so we'll break him easy with a little added pear.<br /><br />He seemed to enjoy this flavor baby food. Kept opening his mouth for more. This was a great way to introduce the baby to greens in a puree form mixed in with a sweet fruit but I notice this brand is a little pricey.  Once he starts liking a little texture in his food I would rather make this combo myself."
1959,"The crunch, the savorriness , the lovely no time this month expiration dte. I love these chips, theyre the only chips I eat without  feeling like i over ate. The package came on time and with all that i payed for."
1960,"The can of oatmeal clearly says they use Life's DHA (manufactured by Martek). If you research Martek (including their own site), you will find that they use hexane to extract the DHA from algae. Shame on Happy Baby for lying to parents by saying that they do not use any DHA extracted with hexane. Will never reccommend this product to anyone.<br /><br />Also, all the cans that I opened smelled rancid. I prefer Gerber Organic with Smart Nourish instead."
1961,"I take this as needed, it does supply a little energy boost but in no way gets u CRUNK I sorta feel maybe they wont cut down as many trees so they can save the berrys. I really dont know if its true but Its the best Im gonna do"
1962,These delicious cookies were appreciated by my mother and her friends.<br />I intend to try the other flavours available.
1963,"While I usually eat granola bars for a quick snack, they're not especially good for you nutritionally.<br /><br />I decided to try something different and went with the Fruition Strawberry bar.<br /><br />They're 160 calories with 20 calories from fat. They have very low sodium and are vegan to boot.<br /><br />I like the taste a lot, it has a definite fruity taste and isn't sickeningly sweet or cloying like some of the granola bars I've had in the past. The texture is soft and moist and won't leave a ton on crumbs in your lap as you snack. I like nibbling a bit as I drink my tea.<br /><br />Since they're soft and moist, they stand up to being in a jacket pocket or a backpack and won't disintegrate into a pile of crumbs as you hike.<br /><br />One warning: they're more likely to appeal to the adult palate, both of my kids vastly prefer the sweet granola snack bars. Don't be disappointed if your kids aren't enamored with them.<br /><br />Bottom line: tasty, good for you and hiking friendly."
1964,"For a year most mornings I have a smoothie- usually made with the Puree when I want it mixed with tarter other ingredients and the similiar product Smoothie, when I want it sweeter with often banana.  It continues to feel like a healthy start to the day."
1965,"We generally don't buy K-Cups for our Keurig but, we decided to try these out. It is extremely easy to make, just brew it over ice. The coffee tastes great too! We will definitely but these again."
1966,the best way to enjoy this is as hot chocolate. mix 2 wedges of chocolate with 6-8 ounces of milk and heat until dissolved. pour mixture into a blender and beat for 30 seconds on high. delicious!
1967,"This is one of my two ""afternoon"" black teas (the other being Twining's Afternoon Tea.) It isn't nearly bold enough for my morning palate. I love hot beverages, including coffee, tea, chocolate, and even herbal coffee substitutes. I wouldn't describe myself as particularly sophisticated in evaluating them, however.<br /><br />This oolong really does lack the astringency I associate with black tea. I would describe the flavor as mellow and smoky, but not aggressive in any way.<br /><br />I think the bit about this being a weight loss tea sold me on trying it, though I'm feeling too lazy to diet, so I can't really say whether this Wuyi Oolong could help in that regard.<br /><br />If I'm not in the mood for green or white tea, and I'm not feeling too lazy to deal with loose leaf tea, then this is what I take in the afternoon."
1968,"This was NOT a hit!  It's bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second ""gourmet meal"" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing."
1969,"It's boneless, it's skinless, and the flavor is good. I am very picky about my salmon, and right now, based on availability and choices of canned salmon in my area, this is my product of choice.<br />The only reason it got 4 stars out of 5, is because of price. When you eat salmon everyday, it kind of breaks your wallet a little. But I figure I can pay for my health now, with healthy food choices, or pay for it later with medical bills, so I guess I'm paying for it now."
1970,THIS COFFEE IS GOOD BUT I BOUGHT IT FOR A CHANGE I USUALLY DRING DONUT HOUSE BUT THIS IS GOOD ALSO.
1971,We always use the Charlee Bear Dog Treats when training our Great Dane.  They are small and not greasy like so many other treats so you can put them in your pockets and not have to worry about them staining.  Our vet recommended that we use them in our training sessions.
1972,"I had never heard of chana dal before finding it on Amazon, but I am so glad I did. I eat many legumes, and am always looking for something tasty, quick to fix, and easy to mix in with grains. Chana dal fits the bill in all respects. It has a very mild flavor, cooks almost as fast as lentils, and the flavor works well with brown rice, whole wheat or just about anything else. It doesn't cause the bloating that beans like pinto or navy do, and I can spice it up or leave it plain. It will be one of my main protein sources from now on."
1973,"This product was hard to find in our local grocery store. We enjoy the taste of French Vanilla, and at a great price."
1974,"There are several things I like about this product, including that these are naturally shed antlers that are collected, cleaned, packaged and then sold without involving killing to get them.  Somebody goes out and collects these and that is probably part of why they are fairly expensive, even on-line...I first found these in our local pet store...but forget about the retail price, (IF you can even find them,) the price at the pet store was twice what I found on-line, and the antlers were not nearly as large.  None of the big chain pet stores carry these, at least not in my area so far. I ordered these through Amazon and was amazed and delighted that they arrived literally the next day.<br /><br />That said, my dogs simply ADORE these things.<br />They keep my new, and very young 100# rescue lab busy literally for hours, but do not ""slime"" my floors or carpet, (or our bed or couch.)  He loves to set one on my desk as an ""offering,"" which I actually don't mind since they are VERY clean compared to all the more traditional bones, hoofs and chews.<br /><br />Additionally, they double as a great ""fetch"" toy in the yard.<br /><br />Essentially my guys just chew them down to the nubbin's, but without any damage to my stuff. Highly recommend if you want a clean chew/toy that will keep your dog busy for hours without wrecking the party, and helps with tarter build-up on their teeth in the process.<br /><br />Really a great idea, and a great product."
1975,"The products were a nice blend of different teas, all at a good price. I would recommend this package if you are not sure of what teas to settle in on."
1976,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select!"
1977,"As wine lovers say, this coffee has ""nose"". I serve this to customers in my salon who adore the aroma and the taste.  Imagine, the taste and smell of a morning chocolate treat without extra calories. What's not to love?"
1978,"CHOCOLATE. When going GF 10 years ago, I was bummed cause there was suck a lack of store bought goodies. I once had an addiction to Keebler Fudge Shop, Fudge Sticks. I was hesitant at first to but these cause of the price, but they are worth it if you have the craving. I like them frozen/refrigerated the best. I gave them to a GF co-worker and she really liked them too. The only problem I have is once I open one box, I have trouble not finishing the whole thing. oops. I've also tried the vanilla ones, but they are not that good. Buy these!!!"
1979,"When I purchased this the cost was $18.50 plus free shipping for six 40 count boxes.  That was a real bargain since Truvia usually sells around $4.50 for one box.  Now I see it is $34.98 plus $11.99 shipping.  There has got to be something wrong with this picture.  Now you can purchase 80 count boxes at the big ""W"" for $5.86!  At any rate, my purchase was an excellant buy, came packaged well, and was in date for three years."
1980,"These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.<br />Salty enough too, unlike say Tostitos which have reduced the salt far too low.  But you folks might want to revisit your packaging.  You know how you grab a bag of chips at the top and pull apart the seam to open?<br />These seams have been sealed with titanium.  And if you eventually manage to pull it apart, of course the rest of the bag is made of the same far too easily ripped all the way down the side to hope to reseal the bag, as every other manufacturer uses today."
1981,"Like the cherry tomato plants that I purchased last summer, not all of the ""kits"" work as described.<br />It could be that maybe I did something wrong, but with this kit, only the 3 basil pods have sprouted.<br />They were planted a month ago."
1982,"A coworker just brought these into the office--surprisingly good! Sweet and tangy with a good crunch, unlike dried pineapple but not too greasy. wow! Definitely check these out if you get a chance."
1983,"I love the buttered Popocorners and will be ordering more.  Only wish they weren't as salty as they are.  I'll also be ordering other flavors, too."
1984,"Be forewarned, these treats are VERY LARGE. One piece of lung is the size of my palm and almost an inch thick. I'm much more a fan of smaller treats, since my dog won't get full very quickly when I'm training him. If I gave my dog a piece of this, it's about half a meal! The picture here is deceiving. If you're fine with the large size, then rock on."
1985,"I wish I had a bit more to say about this product.  I used both this and the shampoo of the same line.  As a result, and with apology, my reviews for these products will be very similar.<br /><br />The scent of the conditioner is fine (it smells like the shampoo).  It's neither particularly outstanding nor is it bad.  The scent, such as it is, is not very long lasting.  I did find that the conditioner wasn't quite as ""weightless"" as I expected.  It seemed to take a bit longer than normal to get all the conditioner out of my hair.<br /><br />After using it, I didn't notice any particular change in my hair.  It didn't seem stronger or shinier.  It's possible that I could see improvements with repeated use.<br /><br />It simply seems to be a fine, basic conditioner and seems mild enough for everyday use."
1986,"You need to provide a description of this item, so that people can decide if they want to try it."
1987,"Alert:  In the event your dog is allergic to fish, be aware that the third ingredient in Newman's Own Organic Chicken and Brown Rice Formula canned pet food for dogs, after ""Organic Chicken"" and ""Sufficient Water for Processing,"" is ""Ocean Whitefish."""
1988,I love seaweed crackers and was disappointed with these.  Lots of air and little taste.
1989,"Since I've had my Keurig K-cup coffee brewer I have never had such horrible coffee!  Tastes like cardboard!  I usually get either donut shop k cups or Paul Neuman's Own.  Also Midnight Express, ALL good.  But this Morning Blend junk isn't ANY good at all.  Never again!"
1990,"I will admit, these are some tasty little candies. The outer shell reminded me of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDCGYA"">Werther's Original Hard Candies</a>. Once I reached the center, I was very pleased with the liquid honey core to be found there. Each package contains 9 pieces.<br /><br />This candy boasts 100% of the daily requirements  for B6, B12 and C, but that's only if you eat 3 pieces.<br /><br />When the package says ""Instant Honey Energy"", that's simply a fancy way of saying ""It Gives You A Sugar Rush"". It's tasty, it's sweet, but it's only a temporary burst of energy. Personally, I didn't feel any increase in energy, but that's just me.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you like sweet candies, this is a good choice...but I wouldn't use it as a vitamin supplement."
1991,we mix this food with royal canin for our morkie - who is a finicky eater - he loves it.
1992,My husband and I love this sticky rice. Just follow the instructions and you get perfect rice every time.  Even I can make it.<br /><br />The wife
1993,"John Cope's Dried Corn has been a tradition in our family for generations.  My Grandmother was from PA and moved to Newfoundland Canada in the 1920's.  Our American relatives have been keeping us supplied since then, unfortunately many of my Father's cousins have passed away and we were thinking the tradition would be lost.  I am so thankful that you have made this available on Amazon.  It's going to be a New Year's surprise for my 85 year old Dad.  It will mean so much to him."
1994,"Excellent low carb snack.  Great cheese flavor, good thing that they package in a 0.5oz snack pack because I'd go through these in no time and they're not cheap, but worth it."
1995,"Good product, does just what it says it will do.  Works without any harsh, miserable effects.  I am using it as a part of a total cleanse.  I would recommend it."
1996,"This is the best snack treat. When God decided to give us pie treats, he gave the best of his idea to Tastykake. Lemon pies are awesome. French Apple pies have been a favorite since childhood. Diabetes be damned, the enjoyment from eating these pies is definitely worth a year or two... ya' know? Thank God for insulin."
1997,"I JUST LOVE THE REDUCED FAT JIF.  THE REGULAR IS VERY CREAMY, BUT THE REDUCED FAT'S TEXTURE IS A LITTLE MORE FIRM, WHICH I LIKE.  I'M ON MEDICATIONS THAT REALLY RESTRICT WHAT I CAN AND CANNOT EAT.  PEANUT BUTTER IS NOT ON THE BAD LIST.<br /><br />I LIKE IT SO MUCH THAT I BUY IT BY THE CASE.  IF I CAN'T FIND REDUCED FAT JIF AT THE GROCERY STORE, I JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY DO STOCK IT.<br /><br />ONE OF MY CATS LOVES THIS PEANUT BUTTER TOO.  HE SITS AND LOOKS AS SWEET AS HE POSSIBLY CAN, WHILE I'M MAKING MY SANDWICHES.  I KNOW HE PUTS MUCH EFFORT INTO THE SWEET FACE, CATS ARE QUITE THE LITTLE CON ARTISTS.  AND YES, I SHARE WITH HIM, EVEN IF HE IS A BIT CHUBBY."
1998,"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough."
1999,"I know some have given these a bad review for their taste.  I really like the taste - and most would consider me a picky eater.  I think they taste similar to muncho's without as much salt.  When you need a salty snack, this is a great one to try."
2000,"Do I need to say more? This is the best jerky I've ever had, and quite different from the usual stringy stuff that sticks between your teeth for weeks. Is it possible that this is composed of separate chunks mashed together? Possibly, but the result is the most tender jerky ever, with no hint of fat or gristle. The only downside I can think of is that because it's so much easier to eat and chew, you could go through an entire pack before you know it."
2001,"This is the best overall pizza and pasta spice I have ever used, and I use a lot and it is salt free! Buy some!!"
2002,"My dog loves the taste. Even more importantly, she tolerates them very well, which is not always the case as she has a very sensitive stomach and is normally on a limited ingredients diet.<br /><br />I don't know how the teeth cleaning factor is supposed to work. It does not take my dog long time to eat a biscuit. I believe more in dental bones as she spends considerably longer time chewing on them."
2003,We have ordered these Blue Diamond almonds at least three times. My husband and I eat a serving of almonds and an ounce of dark chocolate after dinner each night. These almonds are an economical way of doing that and they are delicious.
2004,"My Mother bought the 90's box for me as a Christmas present, and it was BY FAR my favorite gift of the season! LOL! I am a huge candy freak, and this box had all of my favorites: apple heads, pop rocks, airheads, nerds, blow pops, you name it. It came packaged well, and was such a fun surprise when I opened it and dug through all of the candy inside. I loved it so much that I just ordered another one for myself! I think this makes a great gift, especially for people who you know just absolutely LOVE candy. 5 stars!"
2005,"depends.  i don't have a sweet tooth, and these are NOT sweet.  Even then, it's not great.  but it's nice in a pinch when my blood sugar drops and i'm hungry and there is one in my purse."
2006,"I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!"
2007,We were very pleased with this product and the short time in which we received it.
2008,"The headline says it all. The flowers were in good condition, but the bouquet was rather small. Quite disappointing taking into consideration the other reviews. The delievery was a few days early, but better early than late I guess."
2009,"Label clearly says ""Cranberry, JUICE COCTAIL FROM CONCENTRATE with other natual flavors"",verbatum incl. caps on, except the word Cranberry is 4 x as larger than the other wording below it.  How the heck can they claim it's not from concentrate when it's clearly worded otherwise on the front of the label!<br />I was expecting to actually get to taste natural juice for a change...boy was I wrong.  How do they get off writing their story when the label clearly states otherwise?  It's ridiculous.<br />It has a slight cran tang to it, but a far cry from tasting fresh!  In fact it tastes like it's ingredients...THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER and the second is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP...the worst ingredient ever!<br />I AM APAULED AT THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT GOING ON HERE, SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THEM...they advertise natural juice not from concentrate while trying to sell their product, then you get water, high fructose corn syrup and a little natural juice that is from concentrate!<br />SHOOT THIS COMPANY'S ADVERTISING EXEC IN THE HEAD, he's trying to kill us with the ingredients and I am actually drinking the crud because I paid so much for it, so he's probably adding to my death.<br />I can throw it out because Amazon said they will make good and are investigating the product's advertisement...Amazon has great morals, thanks Amazon...hope you like the pics that prove I am not a crazy, irate customer.<br />27% juice, the rest water and high fructose corn syrup (worse for you than sugar)...I posted pictures."
2010,"The price is really good compared to the granola that I used to get from the farmer's market, however, it tastes....... just like some sort of organic waste."
2011,This tea is delicicious and so sweet without any added<br />sweeteners. All my guests love it whether hot or iced.
2012,"Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand."
2013,I bought my first box of the dried cherries recently and they are excellent. This morning I used my raisin bread recipe and made cherry bread by substituting the raisins (omit the cinnamon) and the loaf tastes wonderful. I could make these and give them as gifts. The flavor sparkles and I am very pleased. I will continue to buy these cherries from Traverse Farms.
2014,"I am Italian and have grown up in Italy always drinking espresso from Moka machines. In our house we traditionally drank Lavazza, either Crema e Gusto or Oro ! I find crema e gusto less acid and a better value. I also loe pro but buy it only if on sale...not worth the difference. Ciao e buon caffe' !"
2015,Whole wheat couscous is so versatile - so easy to fix - ready at a moment's notice to accompany a meal.  Freezes well with my leftovers for lunch.  Excellent product and I did the subscribe and save program.
2016,"Beneful has both soft (not moist, just soft) chunks and hard chunks, so you'd need to look elsewhere if your dog couldn't eat hard dog food.  Though beef is prominently mentioned on the package, mention is harder to find and is further down on the ingredients list.  However, it is preferred by my dog.  Though it shouldn't matter for a human, it's also more appetizing to look at."
2017,"Excellent rice!! This is a great buy for anyone who likes the nutty freshness of wild and brown rice. Yes, we will order again."
2018,"I buy this at the local liquer store.  No it doesn't taste like the drink you make at home in the blender, no it doesn't taste like a restaurant drink, BUT it's probably a 10th of the calories.  If you're trying to lose weight, or if you like to watch your figure, IT TASTES GREAT.  You can drink it and be happy and not feel bad like you would if you sucked down a 500 cal pina colada.  This is my favorite, so far, of all of Bethenny's drink line."
2019,"This works great if you need fewer than 2-3 eggs.  The real secret to getting it to work really well seems to be beating it with a whisk until it's almost stiff like egg whites.  That helps it to fluff and work.  Do not try to just dump it in with a mix.  I fold in the egg replacer much like I would egg whites near the end of whatever I'm mixing.  It works great then--great for pancakes, cakes, and other similar baking things.  I've also used it in casseroles that call for eggs."
2020,"This product used to work in past years.  But now, it will not dispense the chemical.  This has happened with the last two bottles I bought."
2021,"I have been using Lavazza beans for years, first at my cafe in VT and now as a regular coffee drinker at home.<br />Previously I bought the Super Crema beans. But I prefer all Arabica so I have switched to Pienaroma.<br />I find these beans make a smoother espresso with a sweeter finish. The crema is rich and thick.<br />You can drink this brew as an espresso or with milk. It makes a better espresso than blends with robusta beans.<br />My only criticism is that the beans are not as fresh as I would like. I have had them when it was clear they were<br />freshly roasted as soon as I opened the bag. The aroma was intoxicating. However, the convenience of getting<br />these beans sent directly at a good price makes up for the lack of freshness.<br />However, I have to add that I have been a coffee ""fanatic"" all my life and now at this late age of 69 I have<br />relaxed my standards just a little bit. It's a lot of work to have the perfect beans and the perfect espresso.<br />This makes an espresso that is very, very good and if the beans aren't the freshest, then that's ok with me."
2022,"I just tasted my first Kaia-brand Sea Salt and Vinegar Kale Chips and truly, they were the worst chips I've ever tasted.  I should say ""chip"" rather than ""chips"" because one was my limit.  It was bitter and rancid-tasting and the bitterness stayed with me for hours.  I love kale and I love sea salt and vinegar, but Kaia ruined the combination for me."
2023,"My whole family seemed to eat these like they were candy I know they are better than candy but, I don't think they are an actual health food."
2024,"i am european, addicted not only to coffee but to GOOD coffee. and ILLY is just THE BEST!! can't start my day without an ILLY espresso or a DOUBLE one ;-)"
2025,"I like the tea, but it's not only chocolate and puerh, it does have roobios red tea in it and i think nutmeg and cinnamon, so it tastes kinda like a chai mix with puerh mix with red mix with slight cocoa flavor...it's ok..but by far not that great and not the my favorite."
2026,I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY AUNTS FOR CHRISTMAS I HAD BOUGHT THEM A KERIG COFFEE MAKER AND LOTS OF DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF COFFEE TO GO WITH IT.
2027,The water bottles are smaller than I wanted. I could not find larger<br />bottles to order. Great water. Prefer larger bottles.
2028,"This is the best gum I've found since Hershey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago.  (This stuff is also made by Hershey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while.  The texture stays ""chewably soft"" for even longer.  Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample.  If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, one of these packs costs over a dime a piece.  It can be less, per piece, here but buying multiple ""tubs"" (designed to fit in a car cup holder) is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum.  I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some.  And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on."
2029,"This treat is just okay. Wish the treats held up better. I got a bag with lots of settling - more crumbs than pieces. Won't buy again.<br /><br />Found use for the crumbs - hide a pill in the palm of your hand and cover with crumbs.  Licks it all up.  She turns her nose up at pill pockets, which worked for a while but not anymore.<br /><br />5 mos later - I'm on my 3rd bag and have gotten others to try crumbling it on dry kibble.  Friend's rescue likes the beef.  The name is a little misleading - it's not crunchy.  Maybe they should call it Carnivore Crumble...."
2030,"I can't believe this Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers actually tastes good!  And furthermore, the directions are simple, written well, complete with pictures if you can't read instructions well.  In other words, if all fails, look at the pictures!<br /><br />The packaging is compact, a bowl with the pasta, a lid that becomes the strainer, and another lid that contains the sauce.  It requires 3 and 1/2 minutes to cook the pasta.  And microwaving is safe; it doesn't make it coarse or soggy.  Let it set a minute and heat the sauce for 30 seconds.  Easy, a lunch/meal in less than 5 minutes.  This isn't meant to be enough for a dinner/meal, so you hearty eaters can open a can of vegetables and there you have a meal.<br /><br />One note on cooking the pasta.  Make sure the water covers every piece of pasta, otherwise you may get a hard end on the ziti.<br /><br />Take this for lunch on the go.  Eat it for a quick dinner and you have a tasty meal.  There are only 6 grams of fat, and 2g of saturated fat, and 230 calories.  Total carbs are 56g and 15g of protain.<br /><br />Nonrefrigerated!<br />The special thing here is that the meat sauce with enough meat, does not have to be refrigerated.  So, my only guess is that is is hydrated or dehydrated, whatever they call it, so it doesn't need refrigeration.<br /><br />Quick and easy prep time, and tasty!.......Rizzo"
2031,Bought some of these in New Mexico at a co-op store and couldn't find them locally in Florida. Bought on line thru Amazon at a lower price and free shipping. The candy is wonderful and it's truly a sweet deal.
2032,"A friend of mine used to eat this as a kid (once he tried it, he never ate regular spaghetti again) until they stopped selling it.  He found it recently in a store where he lives now, and I got to try it.  Fantastic!<br /><br />That store is gone now, and none of the others carried it.  We even tried special order from one store.  They emailed back saying it wasn't in thier everyday catalog or through a special order catalog.  They knew it was still made, but were unable to get it for us.<br /><br />Got the amazon box fast, in good condition, and plenty of time to finish off all 12 boxes before expiration date."
2033,"Ah, the absolute best seasoning. I use it on everything from steak, to fish, to potatoes, to bacon. This is going to last me much longer than those annoying overpriced tiny bottles!"
2034,"Nice tart lemonade flavor with just a hint of raspberry. I don't care for overly sweet drink mixes, and this one is just about perfect. I like it better than Crystal Light's lemonade or pink lemonade.<br /><br />My local store carries this, but at nearly double the cost here on Amazon (although Amazon's prices vary widely from seller to seller). I need to drink more water, and this helps."
2035,"At the price of oolong, the blend is truly economical. I do, however, recommend  brewing a little longer than usual as the tea is not particularly strong for an organic one."
2036,"I've always been happy with the organic Puffs and so I decided to try the Super Puffs.  Not at all happy, they have added sugar.  I'm going to donate the unopened packages I have left.  I wonder why they decided to add sugar?  Not necessary and I certainly won't buy these again.  They taste like Fruit Loops."
2037,"my doberman puppy refused to eat these treats and I when i mixed these treats with his regular food, he refused to eat his regular food. Furthermore,  some of these treats accidentally got spilled into a bag of cat food, after removing the dog treats, the cats refused to eat their regular food! Had to throw out the entire bag. Not sure if it's something wrong with the particular bag I got or if my pets are completely different from the other reviewers' pets."
2038,"I LOVE THESE. Started using post labor.  GREAT cup of coffee, just DON'T follow directions. Make sure water is a ROLLING BOIL, not just hot, then leave the bag in for 5 full minutes. Perfect every time. I don't suggest longer than that unless you want it bitter. 5 minutes delivers a decently strong cup without bitterness (when lightly sweetened & a touch of cream). I use a large 16-20oz mug and two bags."
2039,"Despite the Douwe Egberts name on the label, Senseo Dark Roast is not particularly good coffee, but the price is right; the pods fit the Senseo coffee maker, and they are probably the least expensive dark roast available, although calling it ""French Roast"" is a misnomer.  When I feel wealthy and successful, I splurge on Community Dark Roast pods or Lavazza gran filtro, both of which are much better coffee and cost twice as much.  Still, the Senseo system beats the heck out of trying to assemble an espresso machine while half-asleep early in the morning."
2040,"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet."
2041,"... It would be of the brand Sapporo Ichiban! Seriously, it's insane how good ichiban is! Though this review is specifically for the Beef flavour, I would definitely suggest branching out. My favorite is the Miso"
2042,"With one dog who'll eat anything and another who's quite finicky it was good to find something they both liked.  Not a ""stand alone"" food, it's meant to be mixed with kibble for a complete diet.  My fussy boy loves it...and he doesn't love much!"
2043,"I recommend that you call the company and ask them yourself. This formula is 100% safe! I have been giving it to my 6 month old for the last 6 months and he loves it! If you call your product organic, it has to pass a lot of tests and regulations. Earth's Best will guarantee its purity. Call them and find out for yourself. The phone number is 1-800-434-4246."
2044,"these chips are good, and bad, and create moral dilemmas constantly. If wou are strong at will, or having a large BBQ go for it, but as for me, i was in the habit of bringing a new bag to work every three days, had to put in a lot of time on the treadmill to make up for it. BEWARE"
2045,"Sent this to my mother for her birthday and she loved it. She said the fruit was fresh, tasted good, and the cheese was very good. It was so good and a lot that she had to share it."
2046,"Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice comes in several flavors, and I chose the Apple when placing my order. Being neither a physician nor a connoisseur of fruit juices, I can't say much about the health aspects of this drink, only its taste.<br /><br />I suppose a juice made with an ""all natural blend of pure fruit juice and sparkling water,"" that is also caffeine and sugar free, will reap greater benefits than a Coke or Pepsi, but I found this drink a little too acidid tasting for my liking. I was expecting, and would have preferred, something a little smoother. It seemed closer to Coke or Pepsi than it did to, say, orange or apple juice, and I think I'd just prefer to drink one of the latter than have an Izze again.<br /><br />Of course, that's my opinion, and when it comes to food products, well, we all like what we like, don't we?<br /><br />I didn't care for Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice. You, however, may find it to your liking.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks"
2047,This pasta is hearty-tasting and healthy. This company makes great products all around. I love them. And Amazon's price for this item is great.
2048,"Zevia uses the non-caloric natural sweetener stevia and all natural ingredients. Its so hard now a days to get a natural tasting ginger root beer and I find the taste refreshing.

2049,I have used a few different types of fondant.  I needed to make a RED firetruck and the color was great!  The only thing I didn't like about this fondant was that it was a little more shiny than I like.  I like the satiny look and feel.  My fondant smoother had a tendency to stick to it as I wanted to smooth it.  Otherwise very nice to work with.  Very little breakage as I worked over corners.
2050,"Smart Puffs are a really delicious and healthy snack. The ingredients are all  natural, the fat content is low and they are baked not fried.My kids really like these, today I am ordering my second case. Great low price too!!"
2051,Thank you so much.  This product came quickly and in excellent condition.  This was a terrific value - great bang for the buck.
2052,These taste great! Even better when heated in the microwave! You can really taste the banana and it contains a great crunch from the almonds on the top! My new goto breakfast bar!
2053,This is really good dog food and at a really good price. Way cheaper than at my local pet store. Can't beat this for good value.
2054,"If you want a true jalapeno,taste look no futher,we love these!! can use them in so many ways,we have opened a can and even put them on subs and sanwiches,i also used the in making spanish chicken and beef dishes!! will buy again!"
2055,These Australian ginger chips taste wonderful and can be used for cooking or nice added to fruit salad.  We like to eat them like candy.
2056,LOVE the Larabars!  First discovered them when they were giving them out free at an event and have loved them since.  These were good!
2057,I am so thankful Amazon was able to get this cocoa for me.  They don't care this Nestle Product in any sotre from Michigan to Florida.<br /><br />I love 3 tablespoons in my coffee every morning.<br /><br />Thanks Nestle
2058,"I put on a display of Christmas decorations in Mexico every year and was running out of hot chocolate mix as there is no such thing here.  A friend had several cannisters of instant Cappuccino (French Vanilla).  I served it up (still am) and it is a huge success.  If it doesn't taste just right, just add a little more powder and you are good to go.  Put a couple of marshmallows in it (in Mexico, called Bon Bon's) and we have made a few hundred people asking where we got such a tasty drink!!!  I'm hooked and will purchase lots next time I am in the states!!!  Will look for other flavors as well.  I also add a pkg. of instant chocolate milk to around 18 cups for an even better taste.  Wonderful and reasonably priced product!!!  Linda/Loreto, Baja Mexico"
2059,"For $9.99 they sent me 5 two oz. Pkgs. With about 10 small malted candies in each.  That makes each pkg. Cost $2. and each little malt ball $.20 each.  I don't care how good they are, this is an outrageous price.  Live and learn I guess."
2060,Love the half caff k cups. I like the auto delivery plan. This way I never run out of them
2061,I love just about anything Vanilla and this tea is one of my faves! Its great for a yummy treat during the day without the caffeine.
2062,"Finally, someone has created baked chips that have a crunchy texture and good flavor.<br /><br />If you really attend to your health you want to avoid foods fried in oil, top 3 being french fries, donuts and potato chips. Your body has a tough time breaking down the oil once it's fried.<br /><br />So the Popchips are an excellent option for potato chip lovers. (though I prefer the Chili Lime flavor over the Sweet Potato)."
2063,"These treats are the bee's knees.  I've bought them in EVERY flavor they offer.  Venison is a great flavor, but my pups love all the flavors equally, it seems.  Each treat is about 1"" wide and 1"" to 1-1/2"" in length.  Good sized treat for a bigger dog, and if you have smaller dogs like my shelties, these jerky treats tear apart easily into smaller bites with no crumbs, no mess.  They smell like the jerky I buy for myself, and have quality ingredients.  The shelties love them!  I gave a bag to my sister for her giant dogs and they love them too, they work hard for these treats to get them out of puzzle toys.<br /><br />My younger sheltie can't handle grain or gluten... he has epilepsy that is possibly triggered by gluten, so I feed both furkids grain-free everything.  Even if he didn't have epilepsy, I'd probably still feed grain-free, including these treats, because my shelties have *fantastic* silky soft coats from feeding them this way.  I don't buy these treats here, I get them elsewhere, but they are a fantastic deal for 12 ounces of treats, it's a LOT of little torn-up bite-sized treats for my shelties during training.  Each bag lasts me about a month, I think."
2064,"Skyline is a famous chili localized mostly to the Cincinnati/Ketuncky area. There are no beans or onion in the chili itself, but they can be added on top.<br /><br />This chili is exactly the way our Dad made it, with a little more water.  The meat is fine and the flavor unique. It is best as a sauce on pasta or a hot dog.<br /><br />Enjoy it."
2065,"We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says ""Harvest Fresh taste"". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says ""100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order.""<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help."
2066,"Having been turned onto steel cut and Irish oatmeal by Alton Brown, I much prefer these to any other oatmeal out there.<br /><br />I make Alton's overnight oatmeal recipe in my Zojirushi rice cooker <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007J5U7"">Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer, Premium White</a>. The results are outstanding all the time. It is delightful to wake up to this creamy breakfast waiting for me. True breakfast comfort food. I like these oats because there is still a bit of bite to the oatmeal after it is cooked.<br /><br />OVERNIGHT OATMEAL<br /><br />Equipment:<br />Rice cooker with timer or slow cooker<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 part steel cut or Irish oats<br />4 parts water<br />cream<br />dried fruit<br /><br />Method:<br />The night before add ingredients to rice cooker/slow cooker.

You won't be disappointed."
2067,"Im astounded that this has good reviews.....<br />If I went to someones house for dinner and was served this I would probably burn their house down. This is the blandest least appetizing form of this dish I have ever had. Just looking at the  meat chunks that are all EXACTLY the same size makes me sick. Its completely bland.... almost flavorless.<br />It can be saved with 4 drops of hot sauce and generous sprinkles of pepper, salt and garlic and by simmering it to reduce it a bit.<br /><br />I was completely dissapointed"
2068,I absolutely LOVED this drink when we were in London this summer. I am so glad that I can get it through Amazon here in the US.
2069,"Not familiar with what ""chai"" tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  Yuck.Got this flavor in a sampler box and, so far, it's the only Stash tea I've tried and disliked strongly. Some are better than others, of course, but I find this particular flavor really, really unpleasant, which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label.  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and that's about all I could taste, outside a touch of cinnamon. IMO, clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparingly...in anything. Perhaps adding milk and sugar might've made it more palatable - might even be the way it's 'supposed' to be prepared, but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good. In any case, I can't imagine using enough milk/sweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water."
2070,the delivery time was appropriate and my cat food was not crushed. Easy to order. No additional comments. Thank you
2071,"It's hard to even not like one of these delicious organic flavors!<br /><br />I've bought these as a gift to friends at a shop, because of the convenient container, and I had to buy one for myself as well!  DELICIOUS!  Even the flavors I wasn't sure if I'd like or not, I adore them all!  So good, I doubt any kid or adult could find one complaint, except that there is not more :3 and with 150 count, it should keep you busy for a while.<br /><br />Delicious!  Get some delicious organic candy right away.  :3"
2072,This is the best turkey jerky I have ever eaten.  Can't stop ordering it!!! Reasonably priced too!!!
2073,"Delicious.  I recommend it.  It tastes good alone, with lemon, with lime, a little sweetner, etc.  And the price is very good - and is also eligible for the free shipping."
2074,"The product arrived on time, carefully packaged and properly labelled. I've been using the product and I trust that iit is helping me get the correct dose of needed minerals."
2075,"I know taste is a very subjective attribute, but in my opinion Peter Pan is the worst tasting name brand peanut butter there is (both crunchy and smooth). I am literally ""in-love"" with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - I eat them every single day (sometimes twice a day)! For this reason I consider myself ""familiar"" with peanut butter, and out of the 3 or 4 brands I have used regularly Peter Pan is the worst tasting. It seems to have a ""plastic-like"", chemical, artificial flavor that all the other brands don't have. I bought a case of (12) 18oz. jars and I am struggling to use them up!<br /><br />My favorite PB (both crunchy and smooth)is Jif, with Reese's a close second. Both have a very natural peanut flavor, with the Jif winning due to a slightly better consistency than the Reese's."
2076,"I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters. They'll send you $3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so. No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;)<br /><br />My dog loves this food. He suffered from some stomach problems when he was a puppy so I switched him to Innova. I loved Innova, but my puppy didn't - his hair became oily, he didn't seem interested in the food, he began to smell bad, and the stomach issues continued. I did more research, switched to Wellness, and everything cleared up! I like the clean ingredients, the way his coat looks, and how he NEVER has bad breath or puppy farts. Ever."
2077,"I wasn't sure what pumpkin spice latte would taste like, but wow am I impressed.  This is delicious.  It smells wonderful, has a great foam (as any good latte should), and has the perfect balance of spices.  It's like having autumn in a cup.  I searched several local stores for this flavor without any luck.  I'll be ordering more from Amazon then.  I also want the try the peppermint flavor now."
2078,"As I said with the salmon formula - As those of you know, cats can be picky eaters but this AvoDerm chicken satisfies even my most picky eater.  My vet tells me that the cats are healthy and have bright eyes and shiny coats."
2079,"I was resorting to the old trainer's trick of smearing peanut butter on the fridge or a plastic stool, so my new rescue dog could happily lick it off while I brushed him. It worked but it was very messy. Lickety Stik works much better, although I do generally need a helper to hold it while I groom. The big test will come when I next take him to the vet and bring LS along--will it work the same while he's getting his temperature taken? Or will the experience of the thermometer ruin the treat for him? If the former, I'm sure all the vets and techs at our clinic will be ordering this stuff! I was a little concerned with the stuff upsetting my dogs' digestive systems: the new guy has an  iron gut it seems but my other dog has a sensitive tummy. She, however, had some (inserted herself while I was grooming the newbie) and was o.k. We were using liver flavor. Overall, I'm very impressed so far and ordering some more."
2080,"Baby loves this.  She is 14 months old and I scoop it into her bowl and she feeds herself.  I love that it is salmon, which I don't buy for the family, so she is eating healthier than we do! It would be nice it this food were a little easier removed from the package to ensure getting every ounce of goodness, but still love the pouches better than other packages for travel and storing ease.  My older children are always asking to have some of the baby's food."
2081,"The results we have had since we switched to Newman's Own Pet food are phenomenal. All of our pets look and act younger, their coats are shiny, their noses are wet, and they have a bounce to their step. All natural and healthy ingredients seem to suit them as well, before Newman's many of our pets where picky eaters. Now we have no trouble making sure they get their daily quota of healthy food."
2082,"A while ago, a friend sent me a small package of ghost chilies. On a lark, I added some to homemade BBQ sauce and it was a hit. I ordered these ghost chilies when I ran out.<br /><br />They're hot. Even dried out, exercise caution when handling. Usually I don't use gloves; but one night I made a big batch with lots of chilies. After about fifteen minutes of handling ghost chilies, my hands started burning. Even using milk, water, and bleach - my hands burned for about 6 hours.<br /><br />Besides the heat, they add a nice subtle flavor. As long as you're careful, these are really great chilies."
2083,This product is a very health snack for your pup as it is made of 100% beef liver. My puppy does all of his tricks to get this treat. It is a little pricy but the container is large so it should last a long time as long as you don't overfeed.
2084,Community Coffee is the best-but most of all I'm thrilled Amazon is handling grocery items.  Delivered right to your door!  Amazon you're the greatest!
2085,"I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less ""saucy"", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a ""stringy"" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line."
2086,our cat has been getting chemo for the last year and our vet was very concerned about her losing weight.  These treats made a big difference - she has gone bonkers over the Halo chicken treats and she has gained almost 2 lbs. since we began giving them to her.
2087,"When the plant arrived the packaging was not labled in any way, ""do not crush"" or "" keep standing upright"".  If this was done, perhaps the little guy would of had some limbs upon opening it.  Badly Damaged."
2088,"I first purchased these crackers because they have no soy in them.  My daughter is allergic to soy, and soy-free crackers are very hard to find.  I bought them, and to my amazement, my picky husband also loves them!  He prefers them to all other similar crackers.  I purchased a large number of boxes (which I keep hidden) as they tend to disappear rather quickly."
2089,"I just got it today,im glad i can now try this slimming drinks..I was actually looking for the leissure18 slimming coffee but since i love chocolates this one is better.I'll start now weighing and measure my body so that i can have a record on how effective this is.Thanks!"
2090,"This product advertises that it is a soda made from 100% fruit juices and is refreshing.  I was quite disapointed in the flavor. If you have ever been unfortunate enough to drink canned (not refrigerated or fresh squeezed) OJ you know there is a HUGE differance in flavor. The bad, almost rotting component is carried over into this soda. IT even carries a rather odd aftertaste. I was not able to finish the entire can.<br /><br />This may be a feature of the Orange flavor. Other fruit flavors of this product might indeed taste good. But I recommend skilling the orange version."
2091,"7 out of the 12 bags were completely open on the BOTTOM. Taking out the first bag, it was not damaged and I didn't see the issue until I pulled out the second bag. Over half of this purchase is completely unusable and of course, unreturnable. The oil from the bags also seeped through the cardboard box...<br /><br />This is a good product, don't get me wrong, or I wouldn't have purchased 12 bags at one time. But be very very careful and check every bag when the box arrives. I don't agree with rating products poorly for bad shipping, but this wasn't bad shipping. The bags never look like they sealed, but they might have popped open. The cardboard box they all came in was not damaged in any way, so this looks like a product packaging flaw.<br /><br />I will purchase these from the store in the future where I can check the bag, but never again online."
2092,"I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own<br />#0174;Organics Advanced Dog Chicken & Rice Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag]]  Their only treats were Cheerios.  When I switched to Newman's Own brand, I was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting.  With all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry, I immediately thought ""if I can't trust Paul Newman's foods, whose can I trust"".  And, they love it."
2093,Best dog food out there!  Good ingredients and my dog loves it.  We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
2094,"This isn't the best tasting cereal on the shelves, but when I add a little bit of dried cranberries and some granola, it actually tastes really good.  After dealing with digestion problems for a long time, I've definitely noticed an improvement when I consume about one serving of this every day.  You could say I've come to depend on this cereal as a staple in my diet now."
2095,"I love poppy seeds so I picked this up.  This dressing is light - it doesn't overpower the salad.  I enjoy the slight sweetness from the raspberry.  When its done, I'll definitely pick up another one..."
2096,Okay...YUM!  These are dairy free and fat free and lovely!  They are tasty and satisfying!
2097,"Seeds are my favorite snack to eat while watching a game or just flat out doing nothing.  I love seeds so much that I bought this 12 pack of Davids Sunflower seeds BBQ flavor..Oh boy there a lot of seeds.<br /><br />Pros<br />-Pretty cheap<br />-A lot of seeds<br />-Easy to split to get to the kernel<br /><br />Cons<br />-Lays sunflower seeds has more flavor than this<br />-A lot of broke shells are in the bags<br /><br />Overall, Good for the price but not so good for the flavor."
2098,"These bars taste very good, like oatmeal raisin cookies.  My two toddlers also loved the bar, which is not all that surprising because it is very sweet (and a little sticky).  While gluten-free, be forewarned that it does contain eggs so it's not safe for all allergies."
2099,"I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K"">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI"">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find ""burnt"", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G"">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars."
2100,These pancakes are delicious and healthier then regular mixes. Very Filling all 3 of my children loved them. I daresay once you go Kodiak you never go back.
2101,i went a picked up my order today and the box was mashed and the salt was runing out of the box and half was missing. David
2102,"Very nice conditioner! Contains natural oils & left my curly hair a lot more manageable, even after a bath with Epsom salts!<br /><br />Didn't do much for my scalp (but then my scalp is only dry in hot or very cold temperatures, which don't generally last too long in S. CA.<br /><br />Can back comb right through when wet.<br /><br />Smell is OK - not my favorite, but is OK and doesn't bother me after use. (I prefer natural pure essential oils rather than chemical scents)<br /><br />I'm not sure why the cosmetics industry uses so much titanium dioxide in everything from toothpaste (very concerning if you have kids around, but not great for adults either, but it Does apparently make your teeth whiter, and hair more reflective I imagine, yet I can't help but wonder how daily exposure affects a person?!?) or coloring for their products that are used daily (I suspect the red dye #33 might be the culprit that caused some itching after a couple of uses itching? Could have been something else, or just ""that time of year""?)<br /><br />Thankfully this conditioner doesn't contain Formaldehyde, like many, many shampoos & conditions do, & that can cause allergic reactions - especially after using them for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, works well, smell is OK, not bad, but not a favorite scent (but neither are some really great, truly natural shampoos & conditioners!)<br /><br />It does work nicely. If I had to just grab something and the store didn't have my brands, then I would be drawn to this & a few others.<br /><br />To be fair, if you look at the labels of just about ALL good shampoos and conditioners, there are going to be chemicals.<br /><br />My favorite conditioner is Vegetable glycerin with my own blend of sweet PEOs (pure essential oils) from a respectable PEO brand... great for hair, dry skin & you can choose & create your own scents by mixing your own oils. (NOTE: If you do decide to make your own, MANY so-called ""PEO blends"" are adulterated, or stretched out with cheaper oils!<br /><br />Oils vary WIDELY by price... for instance orange oils are roughly $4 an ounce, while real rose oil (Rose absolute) is roughly $435 per ounce! Aura Cacia is a VERY respectable brand/dealer of PEos and there are others, but that one comes to mind. If it says ""blend"" or x% Rose (or whatever you favorite oils, go elsewhere for your PEOs.<br /><br />I just planted my own roses and use a rose ""tea"" & open the windows and doors when the roses are blooming!<br /><br />Really, this is one of the better ""see it everywhere"" products out there, although I'd like to see REAL natural products that work & they do exist!<br /><br />Many chemical additives can be absorbed through the skin.<br /><br />My philosophy is that if you wouldn't eat it, then you probably shouldn't be putting it on your skin, with the exception of mud & mineral baths, which are incredible, and are fine with me in a bottle as well, IF naturally occurring and non-toxic!<br /><br />For a drug-store brand, they did pretty well in comparison. The small is nice, but not a favorite & it does get the tangles out!<br /><br />I'd rather have a natural formula, or make my own, but this one, if you need to jut grab some conditioner & it's good after a swim in the pool as well! Pretty good, but lost a star for the chemicals that weren't needed or really desirable IMHO & the smell was a bit odd."
2103,This pure boysenberry syrup is just right-not too sweet and not too fruity. Bought two bottles and they were packaged to perfection.
2104,I've tried several different cake mixes and this one is the best by far!  I do add half a package of pudding mix to the cake mix and it's very moist that way!
2105,These were well received at the wedding.  They commented the flavor was great.  Just what they needed in their desk drawer for a pick me up..
2106,"This sweetener has a bitter after taste, the pure liquid Stevia is much better (NuNaturals Nustevia Alcohol Free Stevia Glass Bottle Liquid, 2-Ounce)"
2107,My favorite that I won't go without it. Its good for my weight management that it help me attain the weight I want for myself. Before or after my morning walk I eat half of the far with my Fuze slenderize drink its a low calorie drink 15 calories a bottle. I eat half for my mid-afternoon snack and later evening after work in my car.Its delicious at the same time its low in calories.<br />I just love -love -love it!
2108,"My husband is a celiac and we have tried many pancake mixes.  This one is by far the best we have found.  He likes them a little thinner than the recipe calls for, so I add a little additional milk when mixing. The taste and consistancy is the closest to 'real' pancakes.  This company makes many fine products."
2109,"I use this to flavor vanilla smoothies so that they taste like green tea ice cream. This product works well for that purpose, and is inexpensive for the amount."
2110,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM FROM THIS VENDOR AS YOU CAN GET IT CHEAPER AT YOUR SUPERMARKET.  THESE GUYS JACKED THE PRICE UP SO MUCH THAT IT'S NO LONGER WORTH BUYING FROM AMAZON.  IT USED TO BE UNDER 29.00 (WITH AMAZON PRIME) BUT NOW THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE.<br /><br />Wait until Amazon has a respectable vendor selling this item...
2111,"In general, K-cup coffee does not have a lot going for it.  It tends to be dilute and rather unflavorful.  Timothy's extra-bold espresso, however, is an exception.  It is full-bodied, satisfying, with a nutty underflavor and no bitterness or acidity to speak of."
2112,"Packages arrived in good condition, the rice is a simple side I love to have on hand. It makes a great side dish that my kids adore."
2113,"I should begin by stating that I LOVE the traditional Kraft Macaroni and cheese with the packet of orange powder, but I wanted to try something different and this was on sale.<br /><br />It might not be healthy, but when I want healthy I also plan to spend more than $1 for dinner. When I grab a box of mac a cheese I want buttery, oily, creamy comfort food. When made right it can be a quick and delicious dinner.<br /><br />Let me tell you, every part of the process involving this ""deluxe"" version was disgusting.<br /><br />While squeezing the sickeningly dark orange cheese paste into the pot onto my cooked noodles, I could only wonder what the next step was to make this appetizing. Unfortunately there was none, you heat up the noodles, add the paste, and stir.<br /><br />It tasted even worse than it looked, very chemical, very chalky taste. For a second it reminded me of the terrible Mac and Cheese I used to get in elementary school, only to realize I was wishing for that over what I had on my spoon. I added some milk and butter in a desperate attempt to give the meal any semblance of edibleness, to no avail.<br /><br />I not only threw the rest out, I threw out the other two boxes I had bought. I hated it so much I made a point to write this review.<br /><br />...This is the only review I have ever written. Simply disgusting."
2114,"Delicious, loads of flavor without being overwhelming and burning. Very addictive. I ordered several other flavors as well and liked them all. Old fashioned quality is my main impression. The dusting of confection sugar adds to the presentation and taste."
2115,"Though I prefer her hotter sauces, I think that this sauce is a five-star sauce as far as ""mild"" ones go. Marie's medley of vegetables and other flavors, with a prominent carrot note (hence much of the orange color), make this a sauce that is memorable for its flavor and not simply its mild heat. Though I have used it on all sorts of foods, I find that it works best on things like rice and beans, or a mild soup with lentils and potatoes, since a less-flavorful food lets the flavors of the hot sauce stand out better than do more extravagantly flavored foods, in which I find the taste of the sauce tends to get a little lost."
2116,"I started using Ceylon Cinnamon (purchased from Indus Organic) as a treatment for diabetes. I did a little bit of study on the orgainic compounds in Cinnamon. I chose Ceylon Cinnamon because it has little to no Coumarin. The compound Coumarin (up to 5%) is found in the Cassia kind of cinnamon. The cassia cinnamon, widely available in grocery stores, is mostly imported from China and Vietnam. The Ceylon Cinnamon does not contain Coumarin, which is known to cause liver damage. [...]<br /><br />The beneficial compound in Cinnamon is proanthocyanidin. This is the compound that is beneficial in reducing blood sugars in diabetics. I have not been long enough on the cinnamon treatment to abandon as yet my insulin and pills I take. I would be happy to write another review when I come off of Insulin and other pills."
2117,"The seller did a very good job with packaging.Only thing is that the producer company filled the big jar with a half of stevia powder.In this size 2 pound could fit.But this is not the sellers fault!!!!!They are honest,and reliable shop.Nice to deal with!"
2118,"This plant is a class A noxious weed in Washington State, and with very good reason.  Bad choice for a garden as it spreads unmercifully, and the entire plants are nasty sharp and spiny, the flower heads could be used as weapons.<br />While it is true that Milk Thistle has very beneficial medicinal qualities, it is too difficult for the average person to obtain the extract.  Just purchase it at the health food store and save yourself the ugly science project experience.<br />PS to the seller:  you should know better."
2119,"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee."
2120,"I have put 3 stars because my dogs are old and don't like cookies.  I'm sure other people have had a better response from their pets.  I didn't check the product description well enough to notice it.  Even broken up into bits, my boys leave them sit.  I guess it's back to jerky made for humans, so that I have a little USDA inspecting to make sure it's not Chinese poison."
2121,"Don't know how helpful this review will be, since I'm giving two points of view -- my own, and that of a family member. One person in the family enjoyed the tea. He thought it was good with some coconut creamer and a bit of sucanat sugar, and found it nicely chocolatey.<br /><br />I on the other hand, found it pretty bland, and hardly tasted the chocolate. Like another reviewer commented, I was underwhelmed.<br /><br />The other person in my family and I both agree on one thing, however, if you're expecting something like ""a cup of hot cocoa"", you will be disappointed."
2122,"I searched for a coffee that was not extra bold. This is not listed anywhere as ""extra bold"" yet that is what arrived at my door. Stuck with it, I've been drinking it, but not at all enjoying it. I will not buy another of this brand because now I just don't trust it."
2123,"This Nustevia product is the best I have ever tried. There is no bitter taste. It is very sweet and only takes a few drops. On a previous review, I spoke about another product and how tasty it was. However, this one beats it by a long shot. I highly recommend it. I am glad I tried this one."
2124,"Taste is great, compared to the competition, and the price is fabulous.  The only thing I don't like is that there are little chunks of something inside, and no matter how much I shake the vials to try and get the chunks to dissolve, they never do.  So, given the price and the great taste these are a good buy - I just wish they could get rid of the chunks inside."
2125,"This Tassimo Maxwell coffee  from the Maxwell Cafe collection<br />is the choice at our house no matter who is choosing! Finally<br />a coffee that My husband, Kids & friends love! This price can't be Beat!"
2126,"There is so many that say jerk but grace is the real deal.its not oily like many its easy to digest eventhough very spicy but you can season to taste. the flavour you get is phenomenal,you wont regret."
2127,"This is a great price, and easy way to purchase powdered goats milk.  The cheapest I've found, and the quickest shipping I've ever experienced from Amazon."
2128,My cats diet is solid food. I bought this as a treat for him as he gets a little grumpy when we bring the dog in from long walks or trips to the park. I figured a spoon full would make a decent treat and each can would last about a week. At first my cat looked at me like I was nuts and he wasn't overly fond of the stuff. I thought that I would end up giving it to my friends who have a ton of cats as it wouldn't go to waste at their house. in the meantime I still kept giving my cat a spoonful every time the dog got to do something fun. My cat now loves this stuff and im ordering my second 24-pack. Highly recommend.
2129,The initial shipment of treats were spoiled - the sweet potato was moldy inside the bag. Requested replacement and they were the same. Obviously these have been stored somewhere unsuitable and they were ruined. Have given up trying to convey this to Amazon as they obviously don't get it...
2130,"It is entirely my fault that I didn't cross compare sizes and prices before I bought this item, but I did not realize that I was paying $8.95 for 16 ounces of corn starch.... REALLY?! The same cornstarch that I found for $1.43 from another company on Amazon! Shame on me for not noticing... but THIS IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF!"
2131,"My mother really enjoyed this coffee.  Most other coffees are so strong but this she could drink it without watering it down. We received it a day or two earlier than I thought we would, so we were able to start enjoying earlier than planned."
2132,"I bought them at a local foodie-palace, but I don't think the proprietess had really looked at the label. It's a clever way to repackage standard variety tomatoes with an expensive-sounding name. San Marzanos form Italy can be wonderful, and expensive. Canned tomatoes from California might be, but these are not. Stay Away."
2133,"My one year old loves these Crunchin' Blocks.  My preschool doesn't care for it.  I think it tastes artificially sweet, but I'm not the one eating them."
2134,"I don't usually write reviews, but I'm happy to write one about this.  Finally, I've found a lemonade mix made with good old fashioned sugar and NO ARTIFICIAL COLORS!  I think it's a bit sweet for my taste so I like to squeeze a fresh lemon into the pitcher with a little extra water and it's perfect. I had a bunch of kids over yesterday and we went through 6 or 7 packages.  They loved it.  I'm ordering more now and will always have this on hand."
2135,"A friend referred me to these and told me that they were ""freaking awesome."" I decided to give them ago and surprisingly they work extremely well.  I found that the taste of them, while they are dissolving on your tongue is a bit horrid, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.<br /><br />After it dissolved me and some friends decided to test it.  We cut up some lemons and limes and decided to see if these really worked and to our amazement they really did.  The lemons tasted like a 'lemon drop' candy, and the limes were very refreshing.  We then expanded our horizons and started trying other things to see what it was like. We found some other foods to be excellent, and others not so much.  All in all it's very fun.<br /><br />They are, however, quite expensive. The effects on me lasted roughly 1-1.5 hours.  So as a novelty, hurray for these."
2136,"I felt ripped off.  Open the big box, and there are six medium sized boxes.  Open a medium box and there are two tiny pouches.  Inside each pouch, a handful of BROKEN crackers.  You pay for a LOT of cardboard and not much food."
2137,"The seeds arrived in a small plastic baggy with instructions to soak and sow. I let them soak in water overnight, sowed them in some starting seed soil, and they began to germinate rapidly. I think just about all 25 have germinated within a week and a half. I am pleased with this purchase and am excited to watch them grow."
2138,"oh man, i love this candy! it's super delicious, but its really not that sour. I'd always collect a giant cache of quarters and spend it all on these for 50 cents each! =)"
2139,"My kitties crave this food...That's honestly the best cat food out there...We've tried a dozen different brands but my kitties had their final ""meow"". They love this food .They are super healthy cats ( rescued animals are blessed) and they never had any health issues since i started them on Newman's Own ( about 2 years ago). Amazon has the best price and this food is not easy to find everywhere (whole foods maybe but is a bit overpriced). I like the option to receive a bag per month on ""subscribe and save"" from Amazon..Great deal..best food!"
2140,"We have tried many other types of formula, this one is the only one that works. Our baby loves it!"
2141,"I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure."
2142,"This powdered green tea is very good and a consistent quality.  I make it hot.  But if I don't have time to drink it, it is still great cold.  You can find it cheaper elsewhere though."
2143,"I bought 2 cases of this and have finished both of them.  Taste is very good and I enjoyed having one in the morning and another in the afternoon.  Can't honestly say that I felt any substantial energy boost, it was more of a subtle boost.  It's supposed to give you a sustained energy level as opposed to the quick pickup and subsequent drop that energy drinks normally give.  Personally I don't think it has helped my energy level that much so it's mostly the good taste and healthy nutritional profile that made me boost the rating up to 4 stars.<br /><br />I bought this in large part because of the subscribe and save discount along with an additional discount code they have during March.  Not sure if I would continue ordering without an additional discount but I just ordered the acai-blueberry flavor today while the discount is still active.  I'm hoping the acai-blueberry tastes at least as good as this original acai version."
2144,"It's a sturdy jug and easy to fill with treats.  My dogs, however, do not find it interesting and have spent little to no time playing with it."
2145,"No one makes a product like this. It is a one of a kind candy.  It is awesome and has been for as many years as I can remember. I don't even regularly eat candy, but I love it. But, my 89 year old mother has loved this for all of my lifetime and I am 63.  She get's this every year from me for Christmas."
2146,"I have done so much research on coconut oil, because I've heard only good things about it. So I finally got it.My skin has never felt better and looked better, and it has only done wonderful things to my hair.Forget about all the expensive creams(they're all a scam) because coconut oil is all you need for you hair and skin issues.I would definitely buy this again, and recommend it to everyone.Thank you Nature's way coconut oil!"
2147,"As a college teacher, I often give out a little candy as a small reward after the mid-terms and final exams. Even the most test-tired student will smile when they choose a lollipop flavor. I've ordered these several times in quantity of 200. Each time the product arrived in excellent condition with prompt delivery. I like that I can easily recycle the exterior paper boxes but I wish that the inner plastic liner were recyclable as well."
2148,"Wow. I saw these for the first time at Jewel and, being a big fan of Cheez-its, I bought them.<br /><br />Big mistake. This mix is GROSS. Cheetos and Cheez-its do not go together well. The Cheetos' powder gets on everything so it's really messy to eat, too.<br /><br />I frown every time I see these on the shelves now. What a disappointment.<br /><br />Cheez-Its Snack Mix: Not Even Once"
2149,"I love Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha but it seems to sell-out at the stores quicker then they can stock it.  I'm used to buying the 18-Count Packs which is what they sell in the stores and when I ordered these I didn't realize they were 12-Count Packs.  The 18-Count Packs run about $11-$12 per Pack in stores so you're not saving any money here by buying 3 12-Count Packs but on the other hand, they always seem to be out of stock in my local stores so the convenience of being able to order it through Amazon was a plus and delivery was very quick!"
2150,"Very good product.  They are a tasty animal cookie with just the right sweetness.  This is an easy way to satisfy a ""sweet tooth"" without the guilt of eating something heavy."
2151,"I don't even remember where or when I bought this tea or if someone gave it to me, but I finally tried it and was totally blown away.  Did you know that bergamot is a type of sour orange?  When you smell the tea knowing that the scent is citrus, you can distinguish it but I didn't figure it out on my own.<br /><br />Anyway, oil of bergamot is what makes Earl Grey tea something different from just plain tea.  The DOUBLE bergamot is what makes this particular Earl Grey tea a new taste experience (at least for me).<br /><br />Here's a link to the Wikipedia entry for Earl Grey tea:<br />[...]"
2152,"This pepper is delicious.  I didn't realize what a rich flavor pepper could have until we started buying this.<br /><br />The grinder is really easy to use, too.  We use a fair amount of pepper, but these grinders seem to last quite a while.<br /><br />And, this last time we bought this organic version, which our grocery store did not used to offer.  Honestly, I can't taste a difference between organic and non-organic pepper, but I feel good about choosing organic anyhow, on the principle of it all.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all of the casual pepper users out there."
2153,"This snack mix is sooooo...good and healthy too! I usually not a fan of trail mix, but once i tried this snack, i couldn't stop! I put this in mostly everything. Yoghurt, soup, rice, etc."
2154,"I have bought cow ear chews for my dogs several times from different offers on Amazon.  Some orders have had large ears, but the next purchase from the same site had ""calf"" ears or partial ears--but each piece counted as 1 ear.  I ordered the Punk Hollow ears because the site showed a ruler beside the ear, indicating that these ears would be bigger.  They definitely did cost more, but I was willing to pay more for the bigger ear.  But they, like others I had ordered before came from the same dealer, Best Bully Sticks.  They are packaged in the same bags, and look like any of the other ears I have ordered before.  They are no larger, and most are 4""-5"" long.  Some are just ear pieces.<br /><br />My dogs do like these, but don't pay extra just because they are advertized as bigger ears--they aren't.  I bought 40 ears for $39.99; right now, I could buy the same ears on Amazon for $22.50, all from Best Bully Sticks."
2155,"These treats are my very picky Boston Terriers favorite.<br /> She is also finicky about dog food. So I crumble these<br />treats over her food and she is very happy.<br />The freeze dried chicken liver crumble easily, the beef<br />are not so easy.  Anyway, these treats are perfect and<br />healthy. I usually order two containers at a time and they<br />arrive in about 5 days."
2156,"The flavor of these protein chips are perfect to stop the snack cravings.  Because of the high protein count, I don't feel guilty eating these."
2157,"Received well packaged and timely.  I'm glad they package these in larger weight bags so they can be more affordable for my dogs.  They love this stuff, and always want more than just ONE."
2158,"The Madras Lentils may dethrone <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E5DKLM"">Tasty Bite Entree, Punjab Eggplant, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> as my favorite Tasty Bite meal.  Just finished eating it for dinner and it was perfect for the winter storm weather because it tastes exactly like chili.  I served it over a little rice to soak up the excess gravy and topped it with fresh chopped jalape&ntilde;o and a dab of sour cream with corn tortilla chips to eat with it.  Yummy!  Instead of serving it over rice, you could also add some leftover beans or lentils of any kind.<br /><br />The flavor is excellent and the lentils and red beans retain their texture.  I have finally figured out that Tasty Bite does a passable job with beans and lentils as opposed to softer vegetables that end up mushy and flavorless and swimming in sweet sauce.<br /><br />Also, Tasty Bite has finally moved towards eliminating the cardboard boxes that the flexible retort pouches have been packaged in, saving trees and lots of energy in package production and shipping.

2159,"While quite crunchy @ room temp. ,have found frozen approach verry '""crunchy""' ~ great product ,using anti_oxidant properties of 'dark chocolate' ~ that is all"
2160,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
2161,"My cat has eating 9 lives in the can for 5 years. She does not know any other canned food at all, but when i put frisky in her bowl she when wide and ate about 50% more than she normally does on the first can. It looks from my cat that when she looks at me she is thinking ""Why have you not been feeding me this all along."""
2162,"After losing our beloved dog last year to a host of allergic related diseases, we have settled upon the Wellness line of products. Wellness has been recommended by persons who have extensively researched their ingredients. To our horror, we discovered that most dog foods (including some that come highly recommended by veternarians) can contain ANYTHING due to the lack of inspection by any type of government agency. Euthanized animals and their parts, leashes, collars, microchips, etc. can be processed in their food. Since we have discovered this information, our dogs are healthier, happier, and disease free. It may cost a little more than some of the other brands but the peace of mind that comes with it, knowing we are not helping to kill our animals in the process of feeding them, makes the effort worth it."
2163,"This spread is sweetened by fruit juice, but the juice gives it a very sour, non-descript taste.  The consistency of the spread is very mushy, almost over processed.  I'd rather have a spread made purely of unsweetened strawberries.  If you are looking for a healthy alternative to real jam, keep on looking."
2164,"i ordered mint chocolate and got supreme. i am very unhappy, becouse you cant return it.."
2165,"I admit to being really picky when it comes to maple syrup, some lack flavor, or are really bitter in aftertaste etc.....this stuff is heavenly and I will reorder it as long as they carry it.  Worth every penny."
2166,"I posted a pic at the top of this page... the actual bar looks NOTHING like the picture on the box.  It's a bizarre nub of a bar - I actually LAUGHED when I shook it out of the package, it was so ridiculously small.  As for the taste... it's chocolatey, not totally unpleasant...but DRY...like the Sahara desert dry...like there's not enough milk in the world to wash it down dry...like I'd tell you how dry it is but my mouth is too gummy and I may be trying to swallow it until 2099 so I can't talk.  If you have allergies and can't have gluten (like me) you'd be better off eating a piece of chalk and a spoonful of cocoa than this.  Skip it."
2167,"I'm not the world's greatest at describing coffee, but I do know what I like. I tend to prefer dark roasts, and I don't like anything acidic or too bitter. This Tchibo Gold is an excellent choice in a moderately priced ground German-roast coffee. It seems to be a darker roast, and the flavor is bold with a hint of a smoky note. Amazon supplied fresh coffee, and as expected the service was excellent."
2168,This is a repeat purchase for me..I cannot be without this delicious and healthy alternative to cholesterol or trans fat laden oils. Great on toast and for adding flavor to rice and vegetables!<br />Search the Internet and read all the good news about organic coconut oil and how great it is for your body's well being.
2169,"This product is very difficult to open, and unfortunately I realized too late that it was more expensive on line than in the stores. It is just as advertised though, and fits the toy that it is meant for, just wish was easier to get into, and a little cheaper."
2170,"It's all cayenne and not authentic bebere. way too spicy, threw it out and made my own."
2171,Great product.  I mix it with some green tea extract.  It's a great alternative to downing 3 cups of java.
2172,"I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn't like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains ""Natural flavor"" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn't even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the ""Natural Flavor"" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient."
2173,"We have two dogs who both love these. One of the dogs is new to our house, and we've used these to help crate train him (he gets one every time he goes into his crate). They're the perfect size for training, and I love that we're feeding our dogs something we can feel good about. I also love the price! We use jerky treats for potty training, but for everything else these are the best we've found by far."
2174,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COEZXC"">6-PACK Pill Pockets for Cats SALMON 9.6 oz (270 pockets)</a> Every day was a battlefield at home triying to medicate my cats because the medicine is extra bitter, and the problems gone with pill pockets. They enjoy to eat them."
2175,"My dogs love them but i am not sure they do any good for their teeth and the sizes of the pieces in the ""large"" size are all over the place.  There doesn't seem to be any consistency in size of thickness."
2176,"This is amazing in a pasta, macaroni, or potato salad!  Even on toast it is good!  The texture is a bit different, but really, it is soy free, so its pretty hard to get it to have the same flavor you're looking for when you're missing a common ingredient.  Amazon's pricing on this is terrible... $11 a bottle?  Are you kidding me?  Whole foods has it for $4 a jar (twice the size of the bottle).  Get real, Amazon."
2177,"I tried this tea after getting a little tired of the plain green tea I was used to buying. I was very surprised and impressed by the flavor! I prepare it with sugar and cream and it tastes delicious. I would buy this tea more, but at my local herb store they sell if for $8 a box. I love tea, but the price is a little steep. Still, it serves as a nice treat for myself every once in a while."
2178,"I had my doubts... but I will say that the Milka bars with whole hazelnuts really IS the world's best chocolate.  Smooth... not so sweet it hurts your teeth, but VERY satisfying when you want a bite or two of REALLY outstanding chocolate.  And the hazelnuts add just the right amount of crunch...  I couldn't be happier with a chocolate purchase."
2179,"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
2180,My wife had recently been looking for these at the local supermarket without success. When I found them on Amazon I bought her a subscription with the initial shipment going into her Easter Basket! They are delicious.
2181,I am not British but I have been to England many times and have dear friends that are there.  One of these friends turned me on to Horlicks and I make it a nightly ritual to keep those aches for England at bay and my 4 year old son loves it too!
2182,"My dogs love this treat - it is their absolute favorite.  My rough collie did have poopies from the sweet potato (he has very sensitive diet needs), but the other two found them easy to digest, and they think they are delicious!  Also, they really ARE all natural - nothing gross on the ingredient labels."
2183,"Oh my goodness gracious are these good!!! The single serving size is genius! The instructions on these brownies use a 1200W micro. My microwave is 1800 watts. I cook mine at 70% power (due to the 1800 wattage) in a 4x6 rectangular glass dish and they turn out deliciously. Thank you, Pamela!"
2184,"I like Green Mountains's Black Diamond even more, because I like a seriously strong coffee, but this one is hard to beat!"
2185,"I've never given a poor review before but these olives are so awful I can't find one good thing to say about them.  I love spicy and bold foods, but the spice here is overwhelming and has such an unpleasant flavor!  I have been soaking them for the past 2 days in cold water in the hopes of salvaging them, all to no avail.  The unpleasant flavor is still there full force...doubt I will be able to save them at this point but will keep trying."
2186,"this was a good price, and was shipped out very quickly.  it works great when making apple wine, and is enough to make 20 gallons, so it lasts quite a while."
2187,"I'm a vegetarian. This was my reason for switching my my kitties from meat based food to vegetable based. I was skeptical to purchase Evolution, thinking it too good to be true, but I was so pleasantly surprised. As soon as I set out the food, they took to it immediately. They appeared to be healthier, with fur that was silkier and softer than ever.<br /><br />Taurine and proteins are the main factors for kitty health. Conventional garbage that they sell in the supermarket that is passed off as ""pet food"" is slaughterhouse  by product including animal s**t. It's true,  they put dried up feces in pet food.<br /><br />If you love your kitty and are concerned for the ethical well-being of all animals, switch to Evolution. Conventional pet food is so stripped any nutritional value that pet food companies have to add synthetic nutrients to give it some form of nutrition. So you might as well give your pets food that is human grade( edible for humans), natural and vegan, and contains the nutrients they need and nutrients they can synthesize. They WILL love the taste of Evolution cat kibble.<br /><br />So people who say cats are supposed to eat meat are just trying to justify their own unethical behavior. It really is about Evolution.<br />Look, we evolved right? So can our animal friends."
2188,"We love this cereal,it is a regular part of our breakfast routine - just add berries! However, if I watch local sales (Rite-Aid, Target, Walgreens) I can get this cereal for about $2.00 a box - which comes out to $12.00 for the six boxes as opposed to Amazon's $26.00. A huge difference for my budget!"
2189,"The first time I encountered Haribo Gummi Bears was when I went to Germany for a semester overseas. I won a bag of these as a classroom prize.<br /><br />At first, I thought these were going to be ordinary gummy bears, but, boy was I wrong. These candies truly are a step above all other gummy bears. In Germany, this is THE brand of gummy bears. Competitors' bags are sold at much lower prices, but few people buy them - and that's because the difference in quality and taste is noticeable. The other people's reviews regarding sweetness and softness are accurate. Haribo has found the perfect combination.<br /><br />During the rest of my stay in Germany, I became a huge consumer of Haribo candies. Haribo sells other gummy candies, but their ""Gold Bears"" are the best.<br /><br />When I returned to beautiful America, I was disappointed to find that Haribo is not so easy to acquire. They are sold online at other stores at decent prices but after shipping, the cost was quite steep.<br /><br />I am truly excited to see these bears offered on Amazon with free super-saver shipping.<br /><br />If you have never had Haribo Gummi Bears, you really need to try some. A 5-pound bag seems like a large quantity, but I promise, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Edit: Nov 2, 2008 - When I wrote this review two years ago, Haribo was still quite difficult to find at grocery stores. It seems today that I can find them just about anywhere. In this case, Amazon still provides a really great deal on 5 lb bags. If you don't want 5 lbs, you can shop at a local grocery store.<br />But I must recommend this: if you will not eat all of the gummy bears right away, transfer them to an air tight container. If you leave the gummy bears exposed to the air, they will get very stiff after a while."
2190,I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
2191,"My 10-month old loves these! They are helpful to teach him how to eat and relieve pain from teething, too. Look around for a better price: I was able to find a great deal at my local BJ's club: a mixed 6-pack for $9.99. At the supermarket, they are $2/can.<br /><br />Whenever we go out and run errands, I make a snack container for him. I mix a bunch of different snacks together and let him choose what he wants when fussiness ensues. He always chooses these or the Dr. Sears yogurt melts."
2192,"Popcorn has excellent flavor and nearly all kernels pop every time.  It is easy to make.  Just dump everything in the popper and fire it up.  I can see where some might say it's too salty, but if it is for you, just don't dump in all the salt!  It's definitely more expensive than bagged popcorn, but for the ease of making it and the flavor, it's probably worth it."
2193,"On a previous order, I was one box short.  Instead of just sending me the missing box, they sent me four boxes."
2194,Dr. Lucy has perfected the chocolate cookie. What more can I say. Scrumptious!! Perfect for kids (and adults) with allergies.
2195,I am well pleased with the granulated erythritol as a sweetener for some of my desserts. Product was delivered in a timely manner and I feel it is a great value for the money.  I am diabetic and this can be used without adverse affect on my blood sugar readings.
2196,"Fast service, great price.<br />The gum taste great.  Will always buy this gum from now on."
2197,"My regular matzo farfel was out of stock so I decided to try this whole grain version as a healthy alternative. Big Mistake. Before you order this stuff, make sure you taste some whole grain matzo first --- if you like the flavor than go ahead. It comes out much darker and more fibrous than regular matzo farfel. In our family this stuff was a big flop. My wife decided to throw the other five cans in the garbage as she didn't want to try and save this purchase by mixing it with regular matzo farfel --- so for me this product was a total loss."
2198,"The listing of the box describes as twice as many bars as there are servings.  Each foil pouch contains two very small bars, which together make one serving.  The 10 count is really a 5 count."
2199,"This gum is a great replacement for all the other gums out there that have aspertaine, sacrine,equal, or another sugar substitude except for agave or stivia.  It is best to buy in the larger quantities because it lowers the cost."
2200,"I used to buy Fog Chaser at my local grocery store, after trying many other brands and other flavors of this company. I was disappointed when they stopped carrying it. Then it occurred to me that I could buy it over the internet. This flavor is the perfect flavor for coffee as far as I'm concerned. I use three or four parts decaf (from another company) to one part Fog Chaser and that one part really perks up the decaf flavor."
2201,Two thumbs up! Quick shipping and the snacks were just what I wanted. They don't taste like diet food at all. In fact everyone keeps stealing them from me whether they are counting calories or not!
2202,"Black popcorn was recommended to me by a friend.  She swears that this popcorn is better than any other.  However, I did not like it at all. I am not saying the product is not good......I am saying it is not my personal preference.<br />I have had good luck with Amazon products but I just did not like this one."
2203,"I really like this tea... It's mellow and doesn't carry the bitterness that some green teas do. (I am a green tea lover and have tried many different brands and blends.) The mix seems very fresh, and  there are real almond slivers and coconut shreds! The packaging is great; no need to transfer to a sealed canister because the bag seal is so good. I got this as the ""add on"" for Amazon but will be ordering a larger bag.  Definitely worth trying whether green tea is new to you, or an old friend!"
2204,I am disappointed in this product.  I love the taste of the coffee but the issue with grounds coming out and blocking the water flow has made the product unusable.
2205,Great product. I have used it for cycling for years. Price was right and it arrived fresh with the expiration good for a very long time.
2206,The malt is great but a package of 20 oz bags doesnt make sense and is a waste. You use the malt 1 teaspoon at a time so one 20 oz package is a lifetime supply.
2207,"This flour blend is outstanding.  I use it for sourdough, and the resulting flavor, crust, and crumb is wonderful.  I blend it 60/40 with the Great River bread flour, and use a no-knead method and bake in a cast iron dutch oven."
2208,Great bags.  A little to big for popcorn popped at home.  Must pay attention to size of the bags thats being ordered.
2209,"This french vanilla delight is warm and soothing on a cold winter day, or even a not so cold day.  I first received a few packs as a Christmas gift and was delighted to see it available from Amazon."
2210,"We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website."
2211,"This tuna-based wet food is liked by two picky cats, so it passes the test, but they are not wild about it. I find it the right food for every other day or so, and it helps if they can finish the can in one feeding. I like the idea that it has no additives, so I know I am getting something down them that is not filled with chemicals or fats and grains."
2212,"Bought two six-packs about a year ago. Today we're down to five working bulbs. Three of them were unusable out of the package due to flickering/buzzing problems. The rest have died during normal use. Really like the light color and efficiency, but these bulbs definitely don't last long at all for the price. Pretty disappointing."
2213,"The seeds might be good but there were only 20 in the package. OK maybe it was written on the page before I bought, so it's my fault. But let's be real here, you put down 100 seeds and maybe you get 20 plants growing, you put down 20 seeds you might end up with one plant if you're lucky."
2214,"My cats and kittens loved this product so much that they got onto the counter where I was storing it (with the lid closed) and ripped off the top and decided to roll around in it.  My largest and oldest cat Harvey had so much fun with it that she kept falling off the counter in a drunkin stupor and had to keep jumping back up to roll around it!  They were adorable, and had a great time, even though they made a massive mess."
2215,"According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."""
2216,"High Quality ingredients. Excellent deal I got on the price.My dog seems to LOVE it, which is extremely important to me because I love my dog!!!I probably would have given it 5 stars but it is rather pricey on a normal basis but kind of understandable with the great ingredients just hard for those on a budget to afford sometimes!Overall great deal."
2217,"These cookies are so moist and delicious,I save them as my special treat. For all of you on the SCD, these are a real indulgence and they are legal too! Amazon has been my best access to getting them. The price is great too."
2218,"I have purchased the Super Bubble bubblegum in the local Walmart for years.  It is always soft and tasty; the grandkids love it.<br />The bubblegum purchased through Amazon.com is hard, very hard, and taste lasts only a short time.  The grandkids have turned their<br />noses up at it, and I am left trying to chew all this pound bag."
2219,"These are easily the best mints you can buy. No other mint freshens breath as effectively as these do, and they taste great. Unfortunately they're exceedingly difficult to find these days."
2220,"We use a box of Mori-Nu Silken Tofu daily in our smoothies.  If you have never made a smoothie with Tofu, you really need to try it.  The Tofu takes on the flavor of fruit it is blended with and provides a delicious and very healthy meal.  Recently the grocery stores have stopped carrying this product so I was delighted to find that we could order a case at once and still save money."
2221,"We love quinoa and use it many ways in our culinary selections. We've had quinoa from various sources, and while it is all nutritious, I'm sure, Eden Quinoa is really superb. It is well packaged, competitively priced, and very tasty. We'll be buying more as soon as our supply begins to dwindle, which won't be too long."
2222,"These noodles are the best.  Extra salt, msg, and spices that will make you feel the burn out of the other end.  With the economic recession looming, I cannot afford to feed gourmet food to my family.  Stocked up on these noodles when Amazon had the $10 promotion and shipped free to my door.  I didn't even waste gas money.  What a deal, thank you Amazon!"
2223,This is my most favorite candy!  My husband bought it for me for Christmas and I think I ate it all before the new year.  He won great points for this one!
2224,"Before I tasted this bar, I was so attracted to the packaging and the beautiful orange and cranberries they were calling for me to try it.  I didn't expect the packaging to be so right on target, and WOW it was!  WOW was the first word out of my mouth after trying it.  This bar has so much flavor it is amazing. I was eating an orange and delightful cranberries with a hint of cinnamon.  I didn't have to deal with orange peel an sticky hands, lucky me. When I am looking for something refreshing to take with me everywhere I go, I will take these Granola Gourmet Ultimate Cran-Orange energy bars."
2225,My Irish Wolfhound loves to chew but her powerful jaws make short work of bully sticks and vet does not like her swallowing too much rawhide.  She does enjoy her Nylabone but was looking for a new treat; I did not like the mess (or price) of most bones with meat product and she would break off the ends leaving choking hazzards.  These seem to be the perfect find!  Even my smaller (13 and 19 pound) dogs love to chew on them and the Wolfhound adores them - going to buy more!
2226,"It's a very rich salt because of the lava mixed in the equation, strong, adds awesome taste to food dishes, and vegetable beverages, I highly recommned this salt."
2227,"I love this hot chocolate, it is really easy to make as well.  We used to use Hershey's powdered coco and add sugar, vanilla, and salt, but this is a lot quicker and taste much better.  That being said, it is typically only $2.99 a can at local stores and $4.50-$5.00 a can on Amazon is twice the price."
2228,"These bags are great! They are light, fit lots of things and the way they fold is very well thought. If you put them in your purse, it's like they are not even there.<br /><br />The only drawback is the paint (of the outside ""drawings"") that starts to fade. Other than that, they are really really good!"
2229,"Good to eat, good for you, and free of common allergena.  Yippee!  My kids like it, too."
2230,"I normally regard granola as rabbit food. But....this Special K granola bar is paired with chocolate and peanut butter so I had to give it a shot. I am loving these! They taste a little like a candy bar, but are very small so you don't have the sugar overload of a say...a full size chocolate bar. I guess the bonus is the fiber & protein added for an appearance of being health food. They are sweet without being cloying and they have a chewy factor that I enjoy. Not crunchy like other granola products on the market. They are too sweet for my tastes for breakfast, but as a snack in the afternoon or after dinner they are just right. I'll totally buy these again in the future!"
2231,This tea is fabulous.  I use it to make iced tea as a substitute for soda.  It's so flavorful that it does not need sugar.  Strongly recommend!
2232,These are sickeningly thick and the flavor would be moderately okay if it didn't have the nasty consistency.  I took a sip and handed it to my spouse it was so bad... who then took a drink and poured it down the sink.<br /><br />I have only tried the chocolate as it was so bad I'm hesitant to try any of the others.
2233,"I love Decaf Cafe Verona, especially in whole bean.  It's definitely one of my favorite roasts.  It's a nice dark roast, but sweet and cocoa-ey.  I like this roast with dessert or in the evening.  The beans are nice and oily and fresh every time.  I highly recommend this roast!"
2234,"When you want a cup of something warm and tasty, this is it. Sometime I want something warm, but don't want a sweet drink like tea, coffee or cocoa this stuff hits the spot.  It's only 60 calories per cup of soup. this is also filling and better than some other food choices you can make.<br /><br />I like the fact that it's rich and creamy tasting. it's salty but not overly so.  I used to always drink this as a kid - and by far this flavor is my favorite.  Amazon is the only place that sells it for this GREAT price."
2235,"I had just taken a Freshly made Spinach, Feta, Olive Tomato Quiche out of the oven when these Olive tortilla chips arrived!<br />Talk about perfect timing....anyways we broke open a bag & I served the quiche with a choice of these & buttered toast crisps...........they ate all the chips & asked for MORE!<br /><br />As I was serving 2 slightly different variations in the quiches, 1 with parmesan & less spinach & one with more spinach & different tomatoes, I asked which did they like the best........they all said the CHIPS!!! I should have just served the Olive Tortilla Chips & saved myself all the work! LOL<br /><br />These REALLY are that good! I have never tasted any that come close & Tortilla chips are a staple in our house, as we have them with salsa over cottage cheese, I make an awesome beans, rice, salsa, cheese, & sour cream dish we serve with tortilla chips etc....<br /><br />As there are only 140 calories per 1 oz bag: 7g fat, 18g carbs & 2g protein,  a bag of these with a cup of low fat cottage cheese & salsa is a low carb (ZONE type) meal or snack (depending on your appetite!!<br /><br />The flavor of the olives is WONDERFUL, with just a hint of garlic.......they are a fabulous combination, I will definitely be buying more, & for the record, the children who had these were all boys, ages 10,12 & 15. They wanted more immediately, but they will have to wait for an Amazon order as you cannot buy these locally here where I live..............:-("
2236,"Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests."
2237,"These might be the best chips I have ever had.  The ""Used By"" date is March 2011, but I had to cut this bag open as it was sealed up so tightly (this is the first bag of chips I've had to cut open..if I really reeked on it I could have got it, but I didn't want it to explode in my face).  No worries, you will be happy you got these."
2238,"When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them."
2239,"These cookies are delicious, a little messy but have a great taste, my kids also enjoyed them, it is a lunch bag must have."
2240,These are great for small dogs or for training. All good stuff in them too.
2241,"I have usually ordered my K-Cups direct from Green Mountain, but thought I'd try Amazon's larger package and subscribe/save. The box of 50 works out to about a month's supply of coffee for me, with drinking a couple of cups a day.<br /><br />The taste is good--it's not a strong coffee, for that you need something like Green Mountain Coffee's Extra Bold.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PA30ZU"">Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic (Extra Bold) K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers, 50-count</a><br /><br />It's not too heavy of a coffee, but none of the cups I have brewed have been the weak water that a few other reviews suffered from. Bad batches and bad quality control may be the issue.<br /><br />If you double-check the prices and get a good batch, it's a better than average cup of coffee."
2242,"I bought Glenny's Low Fat Soy Crisps/BBQ flavor because it was a food option on a new lifestyle program I was starting. It was a substitute for fatty, carb-ladden potato chips. I wanted to lose weight, so making this trade off wasnt a big deal for me- I was willing to try something new with the knowledge that it's different than the chips Ive been eating for years, but it will satisfy my need for salty/crunchy.<br />I was very happy with the product. It is a little similar to rice cakes, except a lot smaller and much thinner. It has just the right amount of seasoning and has a good crunch factor.<br />My daughter and husband ended up trying them, and surprisingly really liked them. They like the fact that they are a much healthier option than chips and they like the taste. They requested I buy a case of the chips in single serving bags. With auto-deliver, the price is great. You won't find this price buying them by the single bags in grocery stores.<br />If you are looking for a healthy chip substitute, this is a good one!"
2243,"I love these for a snack. I get a nice taste of chocolate and mint (in addition to the almond, of course), but it isn't super sweet. I hope Blue Diamond keeps coming out with more flavors. The Butter Toffee is great too."
2244,"After reading the positive reviews about the variety packs, I picked up a bag at my local pharmacy.<br />At 100 calories per bag, this is a great snack that has a great taste and texture.<br /><br />Like their bag states, they are not fried (bad for you),  they are not baked (no taste),  but ""popped"",  which gives them a slightly thicker but lighter and crispy taste.<br /><br />They really are good.  Try a bag when you get a chance...if you haven't fully kicked all your junk food habits, you'll be glad you did!!"
2245,These are the best snack bar that I have found since going gluten free.  I particularly like the chewiness of the dates with the crunch of the Cashews.  The extra Omega-3 takes all the guilt away!
2246,"I made a nice Jamaican breakfast for my family on sunday, everyone enjoyed it, thanks again! the price was right and i will be getting some more soon."
2247,"After trying several different beans from a number of sources, we found this coffee strong & smooth and the subscription a good way of assuring us of a steady supplly"
2248,"First off, a funny thing, when I was making the first pot of coffee, my husband thought maybe it had gone bad and had worms in it or something. There are white slivers/specks in the coffee grounds, which I assumed were something from vanilla beans. I hope it was, otherwise I may have made worm larva coffee! So, onto my review!<br /><br />I enjoyed this coffee much more than the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8"">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> I recently tried. Personally, I am a gold card carrying fan of Starbucks, so it shouldn't come as a suprise that I enjoyed this coffee. As a general rule, I would say if you enjoy Starbucks and you enjoy vanilla, you should enjoy this coffee. If you are not a fan of Starbucks, don't look for this coffee to be the magic sip that changes your mind."
2249,"All AFB's are not made the same. I've encountered one every now and then I actually have to take out of my mouth, but most of them I can take it.<br /><br />They are hard on teeth if you are going to bite, so don't bite.<br /><br />Great for those who want a treat that takes awhile, and some bold flavor. If you like red hots I think you'll like these, but the hot ones are hotter. So, do I get some more AFB's for recommending them?"
2250,"These crackers are my absolute favorite.  Wholesome and whole grain with a toasty crunch that can be a bit addictive.  Great with cheese and dips.  No refined flours or sugars added.  About as far away from a regular ""saltine"" as possible."
2251,"I drink both regular and decaf.  We have the K-cup machine in the bathroom and use it for starting our day off right and ending it with a good cup of coffee.  I love both the Decaf Hazelnut and the Decaf French Vanilla by Timothy, as well as their regular flavors.  Perfect way to end the day - at least on the liquid refreshment side of it that is.  Enjoy!"
2252,"I tried to find the ingredients for this hot cocoa before I bought it, but couldn't find anything online. Turns out it has one of those mile long ingredient lists, and yet, that didn't help the taste at all. It is awful.<br /><br />I had three boxes of the stuff sitting around for a month and couldn't find any takers. I finally got rid it of it at the Christmas White Elephant gift exchange at work. I put it with a nice cookbook, which was the real present, and wrapped it real prettily. Unfortunately, the boss ended up with it. I haven't asked him if his family enjoyed it because I don't want to put him on the spot. Judging by the reviews, there are a lot of people who like it - hopefully, he will, too. Maybe it just depends on how your taste buds are trained. Mine grew up with hot chocolate made on the stove, with milk, cocoa and sugar, and maybe a tiny pinch of salt.  Compared to that, this stuff tastes like a chemical experiment.<br /><br />Anyway, instead of trying one of the other brands, I now heat some milk in the microwave, stir in a couple spoonfuls of Hershey's cocoa and some sugar to taste. It takes about three minutes, and it's delicious. Now, where did I put those mini-marshmallows?"
2253,Lady Gray Tea starts and ends my day.<br />It gets me going in the morning and soothes my evening.<br />It has a hint of something special that makes it a Lady's Cup of Tea.
2254,these are a great alternative to normal sugared ginger snaps. the taste varies depending on manufacturing date. you get fiber and get to eat cookies too! i like em better after the bag has been opened for a couple days - they get softer!
2255,"This product tasted horrible and I would not recommend to anyone ever. It says cherry-mint, it should say toothpaste.  If you want water that tastes good and better than this drink water."
2256,"I have a wheaten terrier (medium-size dog) and bought the large size since his mouth is bigger - it works great as a game, treat, and way to get him to slow down eating his food.  It's held up great as far as wear and tear and I've had it for about 3 months now and use it all the time."
2257,"Taaza Ghee is very good and it's quite nutritious for just about anyone.  Ghee is simply butter from which the milk solids have been boiled out.  The remaining is near pure oil so it is O.K. for those who have milk intolerance. It is superb as a cooking oil - doesn't smoke like butter and some other oils. Also, ghee can be stored at room temperature, best away from light.<br /><br />My complaint is the cost.  It is twice as expensive as butter. For those who need to stay away from milk (dairy) products and don't want to heat olive oils, etc., use of ghee may be worth the price."
2258,"Our older dog has developed allergies and it's been hard to find a dog food that works for him. We were using Diamond Naturals, but I suspect they must have changed the formula because suddenly his allergies flared up and he ended up with an ear infection. We switched to this dog food and he LOVES it. Not only does he love it, but his ear infection is now gone and he's itching/scratching/chewing MUCH less.. We're grateful to have found it and hope they do not change the formula!"
2259,"Amazing Grass Berry Flavor is well-named. It really does taste like grass clippings, with a touch of sweet fruit, but not very much. It also does not blend very  well, with some of the ""green"" floating on top or remaining at the bottom of your drinking container of choice after you finish. Personally, if I want something this green, I would rather drink Green Magma barley powder or similar product. The Amazing Grass product is drinkable, but it's definitely an acquired taste."
2260,"My 10 month old Lab needed some brain toys, and this seemed like an ideal option. There is a problem to solve, and the reward is food - what could be better for a Lab? The problem is that she is a chewer, and though she did figure out pretty readily how to get the food out, she was way more interested in chewing on the rope. When I removed the rope - which also made it way easier to get the food out - she then thought it would be more gratifying to chew her way to the food, rather than rise to the intellectual challenge of tipping the bottle and dispensing a treat.<br /><br />And oh yes, this thing is loud when it hits the floor or cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Pretty durable, considering all she wants to do is chew it and it's not intended as a chew toy - but she has only spent maybe two hours with it total."
2261,"The dogs like it, as the other reviewers have said, but it doesn't seem to be a very good food for them. I wouldn't have gotten it if it hadn't been provided freely for review through the Vine program. The advertising sounds good but...<br /><br />Here are the GA numbers:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.) 28.0%<br />Crude Fat (min.) 16.0%<br />Crude Fiber (max.) 3.0%<br />Moisture (max.) 12.0%<br />Linoleic Acid (min.) 1.2%<br />Calcium (Ca) (min) 1.0%<br />Phosphorus (P) (min.) 0.8%<br />Vitamin A (min.) 14,000 IU/kg<br />Vitamin E (min.) 150 IU/kg<br /><br />Those are actually decent if not great GA figures. I think, though, that this food is a pretty good example of how to finesse GA numbers. Everything after 'beef' is mostly hard too digest filler material. Soy [except for soy hulls] is a rapidly fermenting fiber which means it doesn't do a very good job of absorbing water while being digested so the doggie may experience a laxative effect and end up with diarrhea. Yuk. My two dogs haven't seemed to have had that problem but I mixed this 4.5lb bag with about 3 pounds of very high quality food (small/regular breed version): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007794PBM"">Blue Buffalo Large Breed Wilderness Chicken Adult Dry Dog Food, 24 lbs.</a><br /><br />It contains 'poultry by-product meat' which means the carcas minus the feathers. So, head, feet, gristle, etc. 'Animal digest' - google it for an eye opening description at wiki and then the other side of the story from Purina. Although Purina gives a pretty nice sounding description and I'm sure that the nutritional information is accurate, they actually confirm what wiki reports by way of ommission if nothing else. Purina can't be ignorant of what detractors say about this ingredient.<br /><br />The big chunks that are red to represent beef are soft. So if you use dry food because you avoid soft food for your dogs you won't care for this even if it is otherwise not a problem for your situation.<br /><br />I recommend looking for something else. The Blue Buffalo I linked is excellent but expensive."
2262,It's hard to find an organic applesauce that doesn't include cinnamon! Kids love this stuff... and I can feel confident that I'm giving them something healthy! It's a great deal!! Can't beat it!
2263,"I got an expired pack which tasted sour, but Amazon was nice enough to have them replaced for me. I have had more than 20 packs of this brand, and love the peppered taste."
2264,Definitely buy baby food from Amazon.com. My daughter ate all levels of Gerber. She loved it all. Great great great packaging and always fresh.
2265,"I decided to try these treats because the reviews were so good and the price was great. That and the fact it is such a well known brand I had high expectations.  I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that I thought would love them, however he rates it a 2 star. I was hoping he would be a little more excited about them. They are a larger treat so I break them up into smaller pieces. They also have good things in them.  Most of the time he will eat the treat. Others times he will take it and then drop it in the living room and come back to it later. I will not be getting them again."
2266,"I have an issue with the ingredients.  The very first ingredient is ""Organic Reduced Minerals Whey"".  Um, what is that?  According to Google, it is a by-product of cheese manufacturing.  I can't find anything about the nutritional soundness of this stuff, just other moms going ""what is this?"".  Most other baby formulas have milk as their first ingredient, or whey protein.  I'm guessing reduced minerals whey is similar to whey protein but I just don't know enough about it for it to be the #1 product in my daughter's diet.  To me, it sounds like a cost cutting measure.<br /><br />I would much prefer to give my daughter organic formula but all the organic formulas I've found have these reduced minerals as the first ingredient, except for Baby's Only, which is brown rice syrup, aka sugar.  So until I find an organic formula with the primary ingredient being milk, we are going with non-organic.  I just don't think it is worth compromising the quality of the ingredients for organic."
2267,"Starbucks will not use any artificial flavors in their coffee. For this reason, they were not quick to offer flavored whole bean or ground flavored coffee products. In the shops they offer to add flavoring to already brewed coffee. I was very impressed by the ingredients of this coffee. They actually added ground vanilla beans! The flavor of the ground vanilla beans really cuts through the much stronger coffee flavor. After all, vanilla is a subtle flavor. The coffee beans used are very robust in flavor, typical of Starbucks coffee.  They also add sarsaparilla root as well. Sold at a reasonable price, I highly recommend this coffee for those who appreciate a full bodied flavored coffee."
2268,"This was the best deal on buying imported digestives I have ever found.  Seven large packages of the one and only true digestive fromn MvVitie.  The name ""Digestive"" might put you off but the taste with a cup of tea is out of this world and the price unequaled."
2269,"My kids asked ""How can you review bottled water?"" While most people think bottled water is a silly I will drink no water but bottled water. I even use bottled water for making tea or flavored drinks and even ice cubes. I have very sensitive tastes and could never stand tap water even as a child. The really funny thing is that when I was a kid in the mid eighties I would freeze and then boil water and put it glass bottles and I loved it. Weird huh? Well bottled water is now a multi-billion dollar industry. My favorites were Aqua-fina and Smart water.<br /><br />This Essentia water is the best of both of my other favorites, it is filtered using reverse osmosis which truly gives the purest taste of any type of filtering process and it also infused with electrolytes for real hydration much like Gatorade is with out the added sugar and artificial colors. It is also alkaline instead of acidic which is suppose to be very healthy for the body and decrease internal environment for disease.<br /><br />It is very fresh and pure tasting, no plastic after taste and no weird spring water taste or heavy mineral taste. This is my new favorite bottled water."
2270,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E52WME"">General Foods International Coffee, Cafe Francais French Style Coffee Drink Mix, New Great Taste, 8-Ounce Tins (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I like this coffee very much and it is hard to find in grocery stores in our part of Kansas"
2271,"I have a 50lb GSD mix who is, like many of the other dogs mentioned here, a ball of fur and teeth. We initially did not crate him (mostly because members of my family have a phobia of cages) and as a result are out four pairs of shoes, two pairs of prescription glasses, a desk, a leather chair, a leather couch, two desk chairs, and portions of our walls and several door jambs. Needless to say, we crate him now, but while that saved our furniture (what was left of it), it didn't solve our dog's need for mental stimulation. We saw this at Petsmart (for about 10$ more than it is listed here) and figured we had nothing to lose. (As a side note, he does now go to daycare 3 days a week, which helps with his energy levels substantially.)<br /><br />Our dog loves it! Where soft, squeaky, or any other kind of toy lasts only a matter of minutes (though he never did like Kongs) almost 7 months in, and the dog has yet to destroy the blue rubber ball. We have gone through at least a dozen packages of the ""everlasting treats"" made by the same company, which last on average about two days each for him. When we're out of those, we find we can put moderately sized training treats or bits of his kibble in the middle area and he has a grand time rolling it around and bouncing it off walls to get them out. In the summer we also like to smear peanut butter on the inside and freeze it for ten or fifteen minutes before giving it to him.<br /><br />All in all, this was a great investment for us. So much so that we ended up purchasing a second one that we fill with alternate flavors of treats or keep in reserve.<br /><br />My only complaints are these: One of the balls is very easy to get the everlasting disks into (consequently, it's also relatively easy for my dog to get them out again), while the other is so stiff it takes a very long time to get a disk into at all. After all that effort, I feel like my hands are completely worn out. (Edit: I hadn't seen a few other users trick of getting the edges of the treat wet to make it easier to slide into the ball. I will have to try that next time around). Also, the ball is expensive upfront, but lasts long enough to be worth it. The treat disks are also expensive, though, so that's something I've had to work into my budget.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a great toy for those dogs that need a toy that can stand up to them. Definitely recommended!"
2272,"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5R0Y"">Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />This is a very nice double Bergamot, if you don't like Bergamot stay away, if you don't like Earl Grey stay away<br />It's heavy on the Bergamot people! That's why they call it DOUBLE BERAMONT EARL GREY.<br /><br />The Upton Tea loose Extra Bergamot is a good alternative also.  But for the price this is a good one.  Loose, or in bags it's a nice tea."
2273,"Marley Coffee One love Organic is dark, rich and flavorful with good mouth feel and a medium roundness of tone. Not bitter, but there seems to be almost a salty undertone to it, that does speak of Jamaica and Blue Mountain although the label does not claim it is Blue Mountain coffee. These packets are about one normal scoopful, and can be used in single serving coffee makers but I put one in my 2-4 cup espresso machine and it was fantastic."
2274,"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"
2275,Way too yummy and now i need to spend way too much time in the gym :+#
2276,"My family really enjoys the dried Mulberries in a trail mix I make at the begining of each week.  I use dried Goji berries, Walnuts, Pecans, Almonds, dried Cherries and Cranberries.  We eat about a good handful each morning with a small bowl of oatmeal for a healthful meal to start the day.<br />I searched around for a better price and keep coming back to Amazon to stock up on the 5 Lb bag.  Can't beat the price or the quality of the berries."
2277,"I have previously reviewed this product.  I think the previous review was sent direct to the seller.  I have yet to hear from them, so I will do again for Amazon.  The package arrived on time, but unfortunately most of the candies were broken.  Now if you want a lollipop....you want it in one piece, not loose candy!<br /><br />Therefore I will not purchase from this buyer again."
2278,"My dog can't seem to figure this one out.  No matter how much he tugs on it, the food doesn't come out.  We prefer the Kong Wobbler.  This was a waste of our money."
2279,"My dogs really love this product. I was purchasing it from a warehouse but they stopped carrying them for a while, so I was thrilled to find them here but the price is much more. The item is still a great product and they arrived very quickly."
2280,"This Two Leaves and a Bud tea is, as always, a high quality tea.  The leaves are whole, without stems or tea dust, and the tea bags themselves are well made.  But it's the taste of the tea that matters and this is Really Good.  It has a clean, fresh taste that lingers in the mouth and throat.  One box and my husband and I are now Peppermint Herbal Tea addicts!  And no caffeine, so it makes a great bedtime drink."
2281,"For a licorice addict this will do, but it isn't any better than Twizzlers, and might be worse."
2282,"Tasted just like I remembered, when my mother made it at my childhood farm home. This jelly was just delicious although, due to shipping cost, rather pricey. I received this very quickly after placing the order with Amazon."
2283,"Nielsen-Massey's Orange Blossom Water is dreadful -- primarily because it isn't orange blossom water at all. It's a mixture of chemicals with orange oil added. I bought it and will not use it in my cooking -- I'm afraid it'll ruin what I'm making. If you've used Monteaux in the past, be warned THIS IS NOT MONTEAUX!!"
2284,This coffee does smell wonderful (mostly of raspberry and not so much the chocolate) but it tastes weak to me.  I usually prefer a donut shop taste (middle of the road for boldness) and was disappointed that this tasted a bit watered down.  I will not be purchasing it again.
2285,"I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system."
2286,"Check with Amazon before you purchase. I ordered this tea (and it is great tea!!!)but only 1 of the boxes arrived. Note: there should be 6 boxes of 18 count each.<br /><br />Contacted Amazon and they gladly placed the order again for me. Only one box arrived again! Now I have two of the boxes, at least. It's clear that the part number / QTY is incorrect. The price tells me there should be 6 boxes, but ordering this may result in only a single box arriving.<br /><br />Good luck!"
2287,"it's the best if you like dark and bold. my wife thinks it smells foul but i like dark coffee, chocolate, and beer. this is a rich coffee experience.<br />the only caveat is all K cups are, in my estimation, overpriced. AND they are not recyclable."
2288,"I've ordered tea from many retailers, and this tea meets/exceeds all others.  It arrived promptly and is fresh and laden with flavor.  I would definitely order this again."
2289,"I like York Peppermint Patties. However, sometimes I get a craving for a York Peppermint Patty, but I'm not hungry enough to eat the whole thing. It seems like a waste because York Peppermint Patties aren't an inexpensive candy. Enter YORK PIECES. You have the entire flavor of a York Peppermint Patty, but in the size of a M&M. I like to freeze York Peppermint Patties and you can do the same with YORK PIECES. When I bought my first bag of these YORK PIECES, the bag lasted over two weeks. They might not be the best thing since sliced bread, but they are the best thing since York Peppermint Patties (and personally I think they are even better)."
2290,"...Then you've never been on a diet in the winter time.  If the only asparagus out there was the fresh kind, I'd just go into withdrawal.  Granted, the canned spears taste absolutely NOTHING like the fresh, but that's okay.  They still have virtually no calories; they're a natural diuretic; they taste good -- and faintly asparagus-like.  The texture is completely different -- but again, just think of it as a separate kind of vegg.<br /><br />good cold out of the can with a little balsamic vinegar; and actually, good in soup when you cut them up.  Some relative of mine used Green Giant asparagus for a baked dish that was a lot like potatoes au gratin -- but with GG asparagus instead of potatoes.  Kind of a green, gooey, messy thing, but the flavor was nice.  I suspect that if you sub'd 2% sharp cheddar cheese, 1% milk, and used a bit of Egg Beaters instead of real eggs, it would be a decent low-cal quicky meal.<br /><br />A good, utilitarian food.  Fresh is always better -- but with our 110-in-the-shade summers -- fresh is about 1 week in May."
2291,"Will never order from this company again. The egg nog flavor..?  Nothing but horrid smell & taste that can neither be masked nor gotten out of ones mouth for  hours!  I am appalled & can't get refund & would never give it to friends..  It might be ok if i could correspond with the Company... perhaps i received an odd one? disappointed that company would even sell it, or not want to hear their customers feedback.  Sorry to have to leave a truthful, but negative review..  Had great expectations for a new"" favorite ""flavored coffee company.  Love quality and backing deserving companies..Lisa"
2292,"I discovered Peter Gilham's products a few months ago, and can speak for this product as well as the Osteo Calm, which adds calcium.  As a mature exerciser, recovery is always the biggest challenge, and this product eliminated my reliance on OTC anti-inflammatories.  I'm a physiologist who did contract work for a magnesium manufacturer and I've read most of the medical literature on Mg2+'s importance in the management of diabetes and vessel disease, and I don't think there's a better product than this one to address those issues. As magnesium pulls water into the gut, IMO it's the best remedy for sluggish elimination, and you must build the dose up slowly to prevent stools that are too loose.  For people with constipation, it's pretty much guaranteed to provide an immediate and permanent remedy.  And as magnesium is critical for the complete relaxation of muscle fibers, it's a first line treatment for chronic pain of any kind.  Even after months of using the Gilham Calm products, I still have to have my evening pretty much wrapped up before taking the supplement as it really knocks me out for sleep.  Deeper and more refreshed sleep is also a main objective to any chronic pain condition.<br /><br /> I switched to the Osteo Calm a couple of months ago in my desire to add a better piece to my menopausal osteoporosis prevention, and have found that product to be completely awesome also."
2293,"My 15 month old loves this product. I mix this in with food he does not like, in an effort to get him to eat, and it works sometimes. If it fails, I let him have the pouch, and he sucks it right up, and begs for more."
2294,This is the best Camomile tea for Keurig.  We have a cup every night... LOVE IT!!!!
2295,"My dogs certainly liked it, but dont buy it as a chew at all. My guys had eaten their pieces within 2 minutes or less."
2296,"We are very pleased with Blue Buffalo products. Ordering our dog's food through Amazon.com is the smartest way to go! Lugging 30- 40-50 pound bags from a store can be a back breaker. Amazon delivers in less than 48 hours to the doorstep, without shipping/handling fees. Price for the food is lower than the local pet or feed stores. Great service, Amazon! Thank you!"
2297,"This is the first time I have tried anything from Gold Kili.<br /><br />I added one pouch of this instant ginger lemon drink to 8 oz. of hot water.  After stirring, the color became a muddy brown color, not clear as depicted on the pouch/box.  Nonetheless, the resulting beverage had the pleasant tang of real ginger, on par with a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OSDVM0"">Blenheim Ginger Ale - Medium Heat</a>.<br /><br />The lemon is not overpowering or cloying as it can be in some instant lemon drinks.  This drink would be perfect for someone suffering from a cold, or anyone who enjoys real ginger.  Even though it is somewhat spicy, the ginger dissipates into a cooling effect.<br /><br />I plan to order another box of this instant beverage mix.  It would be great for travel; particularly if you are prone to motion sickness."
2298,"I always have these in my purse, lunch bag, and it is one of the few items my husband will take with him to work."
2299,"My cat loves this flavor of food!  (Beware of the salmon flavor, as my cat isn't picky, but absolutely detested that flavor.)  I was very impressed to find that Amazon carried this brand food and for a great price too.  I had originally ordered it at PetSmart and not only was the price much higher, but I had to pay $14 in shipping.  Great buy on Amazon!!"
2300,usually saladitos are salted prunes apricots have a little different flavor but they are still good recieved them very quick good supplier
2301,"This conditioner seemed to work well and rinsed out without the sliminess that some conditioners have. It has the same nice clean smell that the rest of the Clear line has.<br /><br />I noticed a slight volumizing, but my hair is also about 8 inches below my shoulders, so is heavy to begin with, it might work better that way for shorter hair.<br /> I will repeat my main complaint against all the shampoos and conditions in this line. The bottle seeps a bit when it is left upside down in my shower and it is about 3 times more expensive than my regular less expensive conditioners that quite frankly do just as good of a job."
2302,"These croutons sport a nice flavor though are kinda hard. Maybe I'm just being picky. I mean they are croutons and meant to have a crunch. I picked them up while prowling the warehouse deals section and at about a buck a bag they were a steal. If the family had not have liked them, the birds would have feasted. Not that they don't already."
2303,"I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding. So I tried it. If I drink it on an empty stomache it does seem to help with my cronic nasal congestion due to allergies. I saw no difference with chest congestion. I only drank the recommended 2 to 3 cups a day. Maybe I would see longer or more results at higher doses. I have noticed that I do smell alot like maple syrup even 4 days after not drinking the tea. I do mix it with Honey, if not it tastes awful to me. I never noticed a maple syrup smell on my 3 year old breastfeeding son like another site mentioned might happen. He does only nurse a few times a day now tho. Overall I like the product and will continue to use it when I am feeling congested. I even recommended it to somebody I know."
2304,"Spam is great for emergency stores or as a fried breakfast meat.  For occasionaly use only.<br /><br />Not sure what is going on with these truly outrageous prices here on Amazon occasionally - but you'd better start checking things pretty close.<br /><br />I bought this same item in May of 2012 for $16.32 or $2.68/12 oz can (added 9-14-12 - shipping was free with Amazon Prime).  Price as I write this from BiceWholesale is now $29.46 or $4.91/12 oz can, an ~84% increase!<br /><br />A local store (1200 person town) has it on sale at $2.97/12 oz can.<br /><br />I've seen this happen before (someone tries to double or even triple the price) although my comment was thrown out by Amazon.com."
2305,"Lets not decieve ourselves, does this rice taste GOOD?  Its definitely healthy, and Ive yet to meet a healthy food Id pick over an unhealthy version of itself.  all else equal, I wouldnt pick this over a nice white rice based recipe... but if youre like me, youre only here because you need to cut out the simple carbs.  So we'll proceed, the texture is unique but not bad, the flavor is nutty and relatively strong, which is good I think...<br /><br />I prepared the rice in a zojirushi rice cooker, 1/4 cup of rice, 1/2 cup of water, cooked it on the brown rice setting for approximately 50minutes in all.  serving size was plentiful beside some chicken and veggies.<br /><br />I will try it with some chicken broth tomorrow, an excellent 0 carb addition to rice ussually.<br /><br />to followup, I prepared it again, this time I did half cup of rice and 1 cup of chicken broth.  rice maker seemed to prefer this quantity, and the chicken broth made the overall flavor so much better.  I actually did not mind eating it at all."
2306,This  instant coffee is the best.  I have tried other brands of this type of product including Starbucks Via and this is by far the very best.
2307,"These are a tasty item, and a great value.  I would say they are becoming a staple at our household. I wish the raspberry flavor was a bit more pronounced, but they are very fruity (not artificial) tasting.  Nice, short ingredient list, too!"
2308,"Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more."
2309,"I bought this to add to bread and to make seitan with.  It worked well for the bread, but my seitan just never seemed right.  It would still be lumpy and tough after kneading and never lived up to my expectations.  I figured I was kneading or cooking it wrong.  Once I used up all 8 boxes of Hodgson Mills, I ordered Bob's Redmill brand.  Woah!  Now my seitan comes out exactly like it is supposed to, and my whole wheat breads come out softer and more flexible than before.  I don't know if my case was defective or what, but I would not buy this brand again."
2310,"These chips are a regular in my house now.  In fact they are the only chips I buy.  The BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I buy these in single serving packs because if I buy a bigger bag, it is too hard to stop eating them."
2311,"There are many varieties of bars on the market these days.  I like Kind Plus and tried several varieties.  They have almonds, not peanuts as other brands have and this makes a big difference.  They taste grate and very fulfilling.  Each bar still has 12 gram of sugar, so be careful and do not eat too many at once, but one a day as between meals snack is OK : )"
2312,"If you have a bread machine, you need this gluten. It makes the bread light, it has a good chew factor, artisan crust. It is the secret to the best bread you will ever eat. Use with discretion and as the recipe demands. Happy baking!!! One order will keep you going for a couple months cause all you really need is one or two thsp in your recipe. No regrets buying this product."
2313,"AWESOME BREAD ! ! !<br />Also is awesome that I can purchase the mix from Amazon. It is so convenient to just order a case of 6. Our local Raley's store has a good ""gluten free"" section but this particular mix is often not in stock. Thank you Amazon."
2314,We feel comfortable with this product and our baby likes it and has had no issues with it since we began feeding it to her eight months ago.
2315,I have two boys that love this food! I have been feeding them Blue Buffalo since they came home to me. It is the only dry food I've tried with them and they are in great health. It's a little pricier than other options but I feel good about the ingredients and I know it's a quality food. They both have healthy coats and are a good weight for them. I would definitely recommend this food!
2316,Our 16 year old son loves these Mike and Ikes. They are a regular order given their popularity.  We buy them weekly.
2317,"I am very prejudiced for Dentyne Ice Arctic Chill Mint Gum.  Peppermint or spearmint, or another brand just don't do it for me.  I have been unable to find this particular gum in my local groceries, gas stations, or other outlets (Idaho) with any regularity, so being able to order a case or two makes all the difference for me.  Thank you Amazon.com and thank you Dentyne."
2318,"Sumatra coffee beans have been my favorite for many years now, and I have tried Sumatra coffees from several different organic, fair trade companies. So far, this Sumatra has been my favorite. (Granted, I prefer medium roasts over dark roasts.) It's just as good in flavor, if not a little better, than Green Mountain's Sumatra Special Reserve, but Green Mountain's is quite a bit more expensive (they don't sell bulk bags of whole beans). And like any coffee I'm willing to buy, the company has an explicit mission to uphold organic farming and fair trade practices. If you like Sumatra, this is the way to go!<br /><br />EDIT: Wow. The price on this bag has doubled since I bought it. I paid $44 for this five pound bag when I purchased it. I'm not sure why the price has suddenly doubled. At this rate you may as well buy the Green Mountain. I'm taking one star off my review."
2319,"This is my absolute favorite vegetable broth.  I find it is much more suitable in dishes that would traditionally use chicken broth.  (I know that's kind of a Captain Obvious thing to say about something called ""No Chicken"" but there you go.)  It has a light flavor that blends with a variety of dishes.<br /><br />I don't know how to describe it, I find most standard veggie broths to be too.... ""orange.""  I don't know if there is too much carrot in the mix or what, but this is my preferred broth for just about everything.<br /><br />I just wish I could get it locally."
2320,"This is a great product.  So easy to use,  makes consistent coffee every time"
2321,"I am a flat-out fiend for good coffee.  I ordered Starbucks by mail well before they had a string of coffee shops, and I'd venture to guess that were you to order a vanilla latte there, this is not what you would get.<br /><br />I basically never buy flavored coffees, having learned from a friend who worked for a local gourmet coffee company that if you want flavored coffee, you add the flavoring after it is brewed.  Because many delicate natural ingredients are destroyed by the heat required to brew coffee properly most flavored coffees are chemical.  I would not purchase a chemically flavored coffe, or drink it except as aq last resort (i.e., stranded at an airport).  I applaud Starbucks for the effort to make a naturally flavored coffee, and on thinking about it, vanilla beans seem like one of the better candidates to stand up to the heat; after all, they are used in baking at even higher heat.<br />However, this effort falls somewhat flat, or maybe I should say sharp.  While it smells just wonderful when you open the bag, the brewed coffee is bitter with only a faint odor remaining to remind you that it is flavored with vanilla.  I am not familar enough with the chemistry of vanilla (would have to consult <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684800012"">On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen</a> to see if vanilla is fat or water solable.  Maybe it's the butter in cakes and cookies which absorbs the flavor.... but whatever it is that does it in baked goods is missing here.<br /><br />I suspect that Starbucks released this to combat the rise of Dunkin Donuts coffees.  But to my mind that is like a steak house worrying over all the people who flock to McDonalds.  I am hoping that Starbucks maintains the standards which allow us to look to them for a reliably good cup of coffee.  This is a disappointment from a company which knows good coffee, and which should know better.  It would be a lot better had they packaged the coffee with single serve packets of vanilla sugar.<br /><br />The coffee is ground for drip brewers as is most of their ground coffee.  While it is described as a medium roast, it tastes like a French roast (but not a good one).  Because of the larger grind, I am guessing it can be used with a French press.  I will give that a try to see if the vanilla beans hold up any better, and return to this review forthwith.  It was not terrific brewed in a good drip brewer, which is, how I suspect most people would make pre-ground coffee."
2322,"Very disappointed in this stuffing mix. There was hardly any flavor. To get the ""Savory Herb"" taste, I had to add herbs and spices of my own and even then, it was still kind of tasteless. Canceled my ""Subscribe and Save"" on this one. Nothing like the ""Chicken Everyday"". Now THERE is the perfect seasoning!"
2323,Jack Link's beef jerky is a quick and great tasting way to get extra protein into your diet.  A great snack.  I really like the teriyaki flavor.
2324,"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height."
2325,"I recently had the opportunity to try three flavors of Izzy: Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit.<br /><br />APPLE: There's nothing wrong with this drink ... if it weren't labeled ""Apple.""  The drink smells of apple, but tastes more like lemon-lime (and not surprisingly, lemon is one of the three juices used for flavoring).  I expect something labeled ""apple"" to at least remind me of apple when I drink it.  This does not.<br /><br />BLACKBERRY: This flavor is much closer than Apple in flavor approximation.  However, it was also the weakest of the flavors that I tried--that is, it had the least power, and when room temperature, the blackberry hardly came through at all.  Not that I routinely crack a warm beverage!  But even just sitting on the table, waiting for me to finish it, it warms up and loses flavor. Quite tasty when cold, though.<br /><br />GRAPEFRUIT: Oddly, I think this is my favorite of the three.  It tastes like sweet grapefruit--think ""grapefruit Jolly Rancher""--and it is the strongest of the three flavors in terms of power.  If I were to buy any Izze on a regular basis,  of these three, this would be the flavor."
2326,"The wheat I received was either old or stored improperly. Weevils (bugs) are an unavoidable aspect of whole grains. All grains have weevil eggs in them. But when you buy grains, they should be free of mature, live bugs when they arrive, and they should stay that way for a long time. When you buy organic brown rice, do you expect to find bugs in it when you get home? No. With proper storage, it should remain bug-free for the shelf life of the grain. After sifting through several cups, the bug problem forced me to toss this wheat.<br /><br />Another complaint is that the wheat was not very well cleaned. I had to remove a lot of foreign seeds and the occasional small rock."
2327,Luv to have this as a mid-morning snack.  They are jam packed with almonds and really satisfy my sweet tooth without being too sweet.
2328,"I wanted good quality, fresh chamomile tea.  This one is fragrant which is a proof of freshness.  Chamomile is wonderfully calming and soothing."
2329,"Two of my favorite yummy things in the world are olives and cheese and blue cheese, when served with other food (I do not like it as a snack food pure), is the best.  These olives are quite plump and firm and are not overloaded with too much cheese, allowing the flavor of both, the cheese and the olives, to come through.  So often when I have had homemade stuffed olives, the ingredient used in the stuffing is simply overwhelming...not so it this case. As has been pointed out, the oil these olives are packed in make a great salad dressing.  Also, as has been pointed out, the flavor is indeed enhances when the olives are slightly chilled.  This is odd as I normally like mine at room temperature; but hey, what ever works I suppose.  Really, you cannot go wrong with these little nippers!"
2330,I really trust That spicely cayenne powder is the purest out there. I find no ther labels on other products that specify how pure these peppers they are using in their product! I went through a pound of this stuff within 3 months and my digetive issues are all cleared up thanks to the power of this stuff. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to heal themselves naturally!
2331,"I am so so so so upset that I cannot find this item!!! Ruby Red is the BESTEST flavor of all the Kraft Crystal light products. I have been searching forever for this and when I find any at all, I buy them all up. I have a lower carbohydrate intake and drink all crystal light....I dont even use the store brand......BUT since every time that I find a flavor I love it goes away I will be searching for other brands......One time I found Ocean Spray have the RUby Red grapefruit in singles and I loved it but now no one carries it.....BRING BACK THE RUBY!!!!!"
2332,"All the buzz words are on the box - baked, naturals, simply, golden, no preservatives, savory, real,and more.<br />But do these anorexic pretzels with a new twist live up to the hype on the box?  Yes. Yes. Yes.<br /><br />Pepperidge Farm Pretzel Thins are almost akin to potato chips, the snack made from the wonderful potato. These snacks look like pretzel cut outs with the distinctive look of pretzels but with a different taste and dynamic. Not too salty, these pretzel snacks are a sensory delight.<br /><br />A serving size of 11 crisps will fill you with 110 calories, none of those from fat. I don't count my individual pretzels as I snack, but I would guess I exceed the one serving specification by at least a factor of two.<br /><br />Pretzel Thins are baked in the USA."
2333,"I don't add any purchased salad dressings. Being Greek I follow the greek style salad dressing: olive oil, lemon, salt and herbs in all my salads, not only in the greek salad. I was using fresh and/or dry herbs. And when I found this Herbamare salt I loved it. It has all of the herbs I was adding to my salad, but additional ones that taste great in salads.<br /><br />You can also add it to your rice, to your vegetables, to your meats, etc, etc. It gives a great, light, pleasant flavor to everything you add it on. It doesn't have an overwhelming taste.<br /><br />Everybody that tastes my salads loves them and asks me how I make them. I tell them the secret is the salad dressing. The simpler and most natural the better. I tell them about my Herbamare and now they are all buying it for their salads. And of course, I keep buying.<br /><br />The best part I like about this product: it is organic!!!!"
2334,I do not know what has happened to this product. I once loved it. Now it is completely dried up and almost tasteless! I continued to buy it many times hoping I had just received a bad batch but have seen no improvement. Too bad. It was once my favorite snack.
2335,This is DARK roast coffee.  I did not notice this before buying.  I do not like dark roast as the coffee seems burned and strong.  If you like Starbucks coffee then you will probably like this coffee.  I took one taste and dumped the entire pot out.  The smell is very strong which reminds me of a nasty cigar.
2336,"All my dogs go crazy for these treats!  And I like buying them because they are much healthier than a lot of treats that are out there these days.  They are very crunchy, which all the dogs seem to especially enjoy, and we use them for training the puppies up to rewarding my eleven year old Sheltie.  We buy lots of products from this brand and I can't think of any Natural Balance complaints."
2337,"I purchased this through Amazon Warehouse Deals. I bought two boxes for my mother. For $10 a package it was an excellent price. I understand these were returns to Amazon but it didn't look like it. It was in brand new unopened condition. I normally would give 5 stars except for one thing. The ""best by"" date listed July 30, 2012. I got it May 31, 2012. If it was 6 months I probably wouldn't worry but two months is a problem. So I dropped it to 3 stars. The price and the fact I still have two months saves it. I guess I will have to help my mom finish these off. Luckily they are pretty good. I may buy again from the seller since the price is good. Wish the ""best by"" could have been listed before I ordered.<br /><br />UPDATE (July 13, 2012) Bought again through Amazon but from  another seller, ezee llc (lindasproperties), for $17.10 per 24 pack. That was way more than my original order but my mom wanted more. Seeing it was close to the MSRP of $19.99, I was expecting to receive a product that had a better ""best by"" date. No, this time it was worse. The ""best by"" date is August 17, 2012. I have little over a month to go. Granted my mom will probably finish it within that time frame but this is unacceptable. I'm dropping the product rating to two stars due to unsatisfactory experiences with two different sellers. I should get at lest six months.<br /><br />UPDATE (October 24, 2012) I guess my mom goes through this quite quickly. I purchased through a seller on eBay for $17.95 per 24 pack on September 10, 2012. This time around I got a package that was well more than a year out for the ""best by"" date. So I guess I know now that this product actually has a good shelf life if purchased from a proper seller. I realize my star rating is harsh since it focuses on the seller not the product. The taste and flavor is excellent and I have definitely purchased and drank this multiple times when I am at my parents. I am going to bump the review to 5 out of 5 because the product itself is not at fault. Just buy it from a good seller."
2338,I'll admit on the advice of my trainer I was not excited about adding protein shakes to my daily regiment. I was pleasingly surprised by the taste though. It's difficult to get the powder to dissolve in water but mixing it with soy milk and shaking it up did well for me. It also fills me up for a time between meals while providing me the protein I was lacking.
2339,this tomato sauce has more flavor than any of the other brands I have tried.<br />full of flavor and less sodium than other name brands.
2340,I purchased these K cups in a sample pack from Kurig and was suprised at how good they are.  They are a very light roast and have a blue berry aroma but not a blueberry taste.  If you like a very mild coffee with a light roast then you will like this.
2341,This treats are very soft and they have a good size. They are very tasty and our puppy loves them. They seem to be a great healthy option. I like to put them in the Kong toy or to use it for training.
2342,"It was quite a thrill for me to suddenly find cartons of Big Red sitting on the shelves of a local mega-large retailer a few months ago.  I had never heard of Big Red until one of my college roommates brought some to school with him (and that has been some years ago).  At the time, I found the bubble gum taste interesting, but I didn't get a large enough sample of it to really know whether I liked it or not.  Then, several years later, some Big Red magically appeared in a local convenience store, and that is when I grew to love it.  Alas, the stuff soon disappeared off of this store's refrigerated shelves, leaving me to wonder if I would ever enjoy this unique soda drink again.  This may be a Southern product dating all the way back to 1937, but few folks here in North Carolina have ever heard of the stuff.  Maybe that will begin to change now - as long as the Big W keeps it on the shelves.  Some folks are bound to try it, if for no other reason than the price, which is significantly cheaper than all of the well-known colas.  In my opinion, the carton and bottle designs (as well as the price) actually make this look like a knock-off, discount product.  We all know how nasty those knock-off colas taste, so don't let yourself be fooled into thinking that Big Red isn't worth a try.  This stuff is all kinds of good.  It is reportedly available in 43 states now, so keep an eye out for it - or just order some from this site.<br /><br />There is one issue you need to be aware of, though.  Big Red will turn your mouth red.  That includes the lips, so guys who drink this stuff should probably take a look at themselves in the mirror before heading out for a night on the town with their buddies - unless you want to take the chance of a lipstick joke or two thrown your way.  If I drink it at night, I have to wash off my lips inside and out to avoid waking up to a pillow sporting various red stains the next morning.  It's a small price to pay, though, for something that tastes as good as Big Red."
2343,All natural AND Delicious!  I have tried every flavor and love them all.  Very different from your other flavored peanut butters. I highly suggest trying them (:
2344,"I'm tired of products that promise more than they can deliver. Advertising should tell me what to expect in the real world, not in some happytime fantasy land where money grows on chia pets and all my pants fit and supermodels frolic on the shores of the lazy Guinness river. I bought this product specifically to test the claims made in their marketing.<br /><br />Orbit commercials say that no matter how dirty you get, their gum will give you a 'clean mouth'. I couldn't think of anything dirtier than the cold slushy flowerbed outside my building. So I went outside, waggled my face around in it for a while, and popped a piece of spearmint to test it out.<br /><br />On the good side, the flavor of the gum lasted quite a long time. On the bad, so did the taste of crabgrass, wet dirt and Miracle-Gro. Also, I was pulling chunks of fertilizer out of my teeth for the rest of the day. Not exactly the 'winter green' I was hoping for.<br /><br />In short, Orbit gum did nothing to provide me a 'clean mouth'. As far as I'm concerned, whoever made those commercials are a bunch of bubble-thumping smock-tucking picklejacks.<br /><br />Whoa. Maybe that gum *does* work. Fabulous."
2345,"As someone who is 60+, I remembered enjoying steel-cut oats as a child and thought that it was a product that was long-gone from the food scene...in fact, I remember it was difficult for my mother to find it even back then.  I was surprised to see it offered at Amazon and decided to try it.  It has the same dense, crunchy texture I remembered and a great flavor. In addition to eating it with some sort of sweetning (brown sugar, maple syrup, etc.) and milk, we also make it as a 'hash' where we mix prepared steel-cut oats with pork sausage and then saute patties.  I also enjoy it simply with butter,salt, and pepper.  As you can tell, I love it and recommend it!"
2346,"These new Quaker oatmeal go-cups are delicious, convenient and nutritional. However, Winn-Dixie has them for $1 each. And, Winn-Dixie is not a discount super store."
2347,"Christmas isn't complete without Party Mix. My mom started the tradition with a 1960's recipe from my great-aunt. Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice."
2348,"Another reviewer comments on 50g of chicken/beef vs. hemp being a better protein serving.<br /><br />For poop and chuckles, 50 grams of chicken breast contains 14.5 grams of the chicken's protein. Then, he is right; he is ingesting more protein if he eats hemp with 20 grams. But due to the high quality of the chicken (roasted) breast at 136, I'd much rather get that 14.5 grams of chicken protein if my health depended upon it, instead of the 20 grams of hemp protein.<br /><br />!!! hemp protein is very weak in lysine and somewhat in tryptophan (according to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer, provides on their website after it is studied more than their presentation allows at face value -since it lists numbers but not human optimal requirements), only 55% of the ideal ratio of lysine to overall protein if I did this back of the envelope calc correctly, and both of these two essential amino acids are lacking.  That would give it around a protein quality of 55 when we are looking for over 100 in that measure. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well.  But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers.  In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy.  That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />Chicken, on the other hand, has a protein quality score of 136, almost reaching egg whites (145), and exceeding, soy and most other proteins, making it a much better quality protein - and he is correct in not getting caught up in the ""grams"". Then, there was a PhD student commenting on bioavailability of hemp protein and plant protein in general. He also is right and hemp's nutritional value can be overestimated by not looking at this. A good assumption for veggies is about 80% BV for veggie products compared to chicken, so that makes hemp worse than the 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said, hemp is great, you just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs. The feeling of being ""full"" has nothing to do with the quantity of protein as the other reviewer claimed he felt. As a matter of fact, fresh veggies are low in protein and people eat them to feel full - old dieting trick.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively ""low protein quality"" with other ""low quality"" proteins to get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route.<br /><br />But, hemp protein still has other amino acids below 100, so you are improving the two weakest points with a nutrient dense food like spinach to balance it out. I haven't checked the rest - and now it is time to say ""eat a well balanced diet"". Yogurt or whey protein will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy ... find some extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the pseudo hormones are diminished in the  alcohol extraction. Don't ask me where to buy it but it is out there.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better quality than hemp. As for eating too much protein in general, this can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out, especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins. The excess amino acids are disposed of by stressing the liver in extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver). So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted and converted into energy. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality are very important. Like for preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation.<br /><br />As a final note ... this hemp protein extract 50% powder (be sure to understand when you order which you are getting) goes better with smoothies unless you like eating a woody taste, but still has lots of fiber so just hope you acquire the taste.  Hope this helps...<br /><br />*This makes sense if that reviewer is comparing it to his 20 grams content of protein (40g hemp powder) of whatever he serves himself. If so (and it seems that way from the ambiguous talk of grams, serving size and exactly what is being measured), he is comparing 20 grams of hemp protein to the protein content in a 50 gram portion of chicken breast (who knows - maybe he means 50 grams chicken protein which would be a lot more chicken breast to eat and lots more protein)."
2349,"Fantastic taste, great price, and a healthy snack that even your kids will enjoy!<br />We have tried both the Krinkle Cut chips and the Sweets & Beets, and the Krinkle Cut seem to have a better taste.  We like to sprinkle a generous amount of mineral-rich Celtic sea salt in the bag and shake it up - what a delicious treat!<br />Our local health food store sells these chips for nearly double what Amazon charges for the Subscribe & Save price, so this is a great deal!"
2350,"We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog."
2351,"This mix would be so great if they hadn't put banana in it. The banana makes it smell like baby food and imparts an odd taste too, it is palatable but could be so much better. I truly love mango but the banana kind of over shadows the mango flavor. Any time banana is added to anything the banana taste is strong and the other flavors are muddied by it. Please make a mango without the banana!!!!"
2352,I wouldn't recommend this deck since it is cartoony and the minor arcana is just the number of the suit (ex: two staffs is on two of wands)
2353,"This drink is amazing! They make another that is just ginger ale, but this jasmine tea one is much better. I would definetley recommend it, just shake it up as you drink."
2354,This ios also a great tea to enjoy in the Am. I have also used it to make ice tea directly into the cup. Fill the cup with ice and sugar to suit and brew. Instant ice tea. Great.
2355,"I love Popchips. However, I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense."
2356,Great complete protein. Inexpensive!!  Use in any recipe using rice or bread crumbs. Great for breakfast in place of any hot ceral. Just add fruit and cinnamon.
2357,"These are some of the best training treats I have found.  They are small, and fairly soft, so they make for a quick reward.  I even break them into smaller bites most of the time.  They are quite strong smelling, and my dog LOVES them.  I highly recommend them."
2358,"A friend shows me a box of this stuff and says I have to try it, I go to grocery store and see the price and think no way! He ask's about it and I tell him the stuff is too expensive he is crazy, a week later he drops off a box for me, that was eighteen years ago and I have not bought anything else since, its that good.<br /><br />Really love the thickness of the spaghetti, Made from high quality Durum Semolina. I have found it does require much longer cooking times but that's it, only other problem, I can never eat just a little, I always seem to eat a huge plate full...great stuff.  You can find it on sale in the stores but most of the time it is rather pricey so glad to see it here.<br /><br />Also highly recommend their Penne Rigate pasta<br /><br />UPDATE...The first couple of times I ordered this it arrived fine, but today it arrived crushed, looks like whoever packed it smashed it while they taped the boxes together, Amazon did offer refund but now the price is much higher :-(  Might as well go to the store and get it now, same price but I will show some loyalty and order once more..fingers crossed"
2359,"I bought this  product and when I opened it, I was disappointed to find many of the candies were left unwrapped throughout the box."
2360,"I am on a salt restricted diet imposed mostly by myself. I do not like the taste of most all these other salt substitutes on the market right now. I used cardia salt for years and then about a couple of years ago noticed it was getting harder and harder to find it,even the 1-800 number on the  bottles was useless,it just said leave a message and i tried that and got no calls back. Finally a few months back,suddenly it became availiable on Amazon.com again.<br />  I use it by the shaker,keep a bottle in my lunch carry-all at work and also cook with it. Hopefully it is back on Amazon.com for awhile now."
2361,These cookies have a great taste and texture!  We couldn't tell the difference between regular Oreos and the sugar free ones.
2362,I think the popcorn tastes great.  I reminds me when we didn't have microwaves and had to pop it on the stove.  A definite plus is that it has fewer hulls than other brands.
2363,"I also had heard from my lamaze class that red rasberry tea was suppose to ease and assist in the birthing process(It is a uterine toner). Well, in my case it couldn't have been more true. I literally pushed 3 times and the baby was out, and that was my first baby. I drank the tea every day for the last two months of pregnancy, up to delivery day. I must say...this time in my 2nd pregnancy i'm going to do it the exact same way. I recommend this product to any woman who wants to have an easier, shorter delivery."
2364,"I was really surprised at the quality of this product.  The aroma was very nice and the taste when used was even better.  I didn't realize what a difference there was after purchasing the ""store bought"" kind for years and in this product.  I am so hooked I will never purchase anything else.  The fact that you get 3 packs for such a small price is an even better bargain in my opinion.  An excellent deal for an excellent product."
2365,"These are not the same as regular rice krispie treates, but my GFCF kiddo likes them and they are awfully convenient.  Only wish they would keep labeling the individual packaging so I know what the item is."
2366,"I bought this on an impulse at AC Moore on sale for $5.99.  We made them today and they were AWESOME!!!<br />Easy to make, but you do have to mix and let them rise, cut and roll them... it is a little bit of a project, but easy to do with kids.  The results were unbelievable... every bit as good as the Auntie Anne in the malls, maybe even better, because you eat them as soon as they come out of the oven.  We halved the ingredients so we could do it twice and wouldn't end up with pretzels that didn't get eaten.  And there was more than enough for the 4 of us.  Highly recommend... just look for the best price!"
2367,"The price from 911drugstore is crazy!  If you buy the spinach, mango and pear one, which amazon itself sells, it is half the price (see link) of 911drugstore and about twice what you'd pay retail.  Don't buy from this company. They are price gouging.<br /><br />That said, all of this band of baby food that I've tried are great.  I don't even use a spoon, my son likes to just suck it right out of the tube and has been since he was 7months old.  Great for road trips or just being on the go<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VJ8PE"">HAPPYBABY Organic Baby Food, Stage 2, Spinach, Mango & Pear, 3.5 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>"

2369,"These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy. The flavor is OK... but not good. The bags have 1.5 servings in them (so if you eat the whole bag they are 21 carbs; not 14). I doubt I will buy them again, but I will eat the rest of the carton."
2370,"Great breakfast tea, not as strong as some of the Twinings breakfast, but not as bitter, either.  Seems to make good tea at lower water temperatures compared to other black teas, which is good for me since the hot water tap on the office water cooler is not very hot.  Very economical in the large bags of loose leaf. I use a Swiss Gold infuser which does a good job on the fine cut teas like this one."
2371,"I have 3 dogs and they love these. I'm sure if it was up to them they would eat these for breakfast, lunch and dinner. :o) It's great that they are all<br />natural. I can't keep enough of them in the house."
2372,"I've had a number of ES bars from health food stores;but never this one. After I ordered it I feared I may have gone too dark. I'm used to 70% from another source.<br /><br /> Picked up some of my 'other source' chocolate for a side by side. I can no longer go back to that one. I'm used to the less sweet taste of THIS ONE.<br /><br />Discovered something interesting about these. Half of one melted in my car after a long trip. I put it in the fridge to save it. It tasted better after it's been melted first. I ate it right out of the fridge. And it melted quickly in my mouth & tasted sweeter, but in a good way.  Hmmm."
2373,"Yummy but NOT frothy... this is purposed for Latte Cafe machines usually at gas stations like QT/RaceTrack/etc.<br /><br />Having purchased this previously at a Closeout Store, I was thrilled to see it on Amazon for a decent price. I use it like ""brand name la-di-da"" French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage that comes in those cute little rectangular tins for a higher price. Just as good and somewhat cheaper, depending on selling price (Amazon cheapest = 6.19 a bag). This size is equivalent to FOUR tins purchased at local stores. Those la-di-das on clearance cost about $2.50 EACH.<br /><br />DIRECTIONS: Use 1.5 - 2.0 Tablespoons French Vanilla Instant Coffee Beverage Mix per 8ozs of Hot Water and Stir.<br />Psst, no matter how much or fast you stir, it will not be frothy :)"
2374,"I love these little steaks; they're tender and flavorful.  I can't find anything as good in the grocery store.  They're just the right size for me.  I also like that they're individually packed, and the packages are easy to open."
2375,"Great treats for dogs- he will work hard to earn these even after I cut them into smaller pieces so I can continuously reward his efforts when I am teaching him new tricks, enforcing commands or encouraging him to walk at my side."
2376,My husband uses his voice for a living & often when over using it he developes a great deal of congestion & the Ginger Chews is very soothing for him.
2377,"I love earl grey tea, however this earl grey is not to my taste.  I didn't grow up in the USA and there is a real difference to American earl grey.  If you like starbucks or republic of tea earl grey then you will love this tea.  If you like a darker, less flavoured earl grey then I suggest you pass on this one.  Right now I am blending it 50/50 with a straight Assam and it is drinkable."
2378,"I've been through two 24 cup boxes of this hot chocolate, and it isn't great.  It's not badly priced, and the first few sips are fine.  But after it sits for five minutes cooling in your cup it separates.  It ends up being watery for the most part with a bunch of chocolate mix on the bottom."
2379,I like to have a pre workout energy drink to intensify my work out. I have tried drinks like redline and they make me feel like I'm going to come out of my skin. This energy drink does not do that. It works great for me. I would recommend it to other people.
2380,This is a really good alternative to the expensive matcha that I have tried before. I used to work in a gym/smoothie bar. I wanted to make a shake that was similar to the one I would make at the gym so I bought this powder and I was very successful in doing so. This powder gives me energy all day and it is delicious. I do tell people that it does have a slightly bitter after taste but with milk added it is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />Here is a blender recipe I came up with<br /><br />1 Teaspoon of the green tea powder (First dissolve the green tea in 3 tbs hot water make sure clumps are out)<br />1 Small banana<br />1 Cup vanilla rice milk<br />2-4 drops Vanilla extract<br />2 Packets of Splenda<br />6-8 Ice cubes<br /><br />For a meal replacement I like to add 1 scoop of vanilla whey protein

2382,"Fage Total Greek yogurt has become my absolute favorite.  I like the taste and the texture. It is creamy,firm and fresh tasting.<br /><br />I have many uses for Fage yogurt.  I eat it as a refreshing desert with or without fresh fruit. I use it to substitute for sour cream in recipes to lower the caloric content.  I also use it to make smoothing.<br /><br />I have tried many different yogurts, but Fage remains my very favorite."
2383,"As a vegan, hemp seeds are an important part of my diet.  This product is great because it helps you to save money by buying in bulk, and its also of the highest quality."
2384,My daughter loves Earth Best jar food. She is very picky about the taste so their varity comes in very handy.
2385,"I loved to cook food with Turmeric. Recently, I read an article that mentioned that turmeric contains a compound that lowers testosterone levels. I don't want to use this product now as I'm working hard at the gym to gain muscle mass."
2386,"It is tasty and nutritious; whole grains, no corn; they have vitamin D; few baby foods do.<br />The bottle and cap are nice, does keep the product fresh unlike other brands.<br />And price is same or cheaper than the regular non-organic-junk fillers-finger food....so it is a no brainer.<br /> For some reason,my baby seems to like more the veggie one. Had no problem picking them up, and never choked on them (he did with others)<br /> My 3 year old also likes them.  And even though 6 bottles may seem a lot.........they go fast.  Expiration date was good (like seven months later)."
2387,"We love these cookies, but not in crumbs.  Unfortunately, the pack of 3 came in crushed.  It would seem we are better off just buying them directly from a local store, instead of through Amazon."

2389,"A steaming hot bowl of CAMPBELL'S TOMATO SOUP for lunch is just about as good as it gets.  That zesty tomato flavor is delicious; your taste buds will be thanking you profusely.  This is a soup I grew up on and still enjoy on those occasions when nothing but a bowl of hot soup will hit the spot.<br /><br />This soup must be accompanied by crackers--better yet, peanut butter crackers.  For maximum tomato flavor pour in water, not milk, and for even more extra zest add a pinch of onion salt.  Now that's a spicy soup!  An added bonus includes the pull-off lids; no can openers required, thank you very much.  Make your lunch a hit with CAMPBELL'S TOMATO SOUP.  The middle of the day doesn't deserve drab.<br />--D.

2391,"Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)"
2392,"I normally do not like ""crunchy"" bars because its a hit and miss proposition. Sometimes too hard, sometimes too soft (feel like Goldilocks). But the taste and texture gets a passing grade from me. Will buy more."
2393,"Nylabones have long been my favorite chew toys for my big German Shepherds. The dogs love them, they last a long time and don't make a mess on my carpets. If my dogs take them outside, they can be washed and reused. The souper size is great for big, strong dogs and last several months even with daily chewing. I highly recommend Nylabone durable products."
2394,"but be ready to spend a lot of time sorting them out. The bag contains small twigs, little pebbles, plus dirt balls and junk. It was tedious and time consuming. But the previous pound I got from another company on here came from Croatia and was not organic plus contains twice as much crap in it. I just thought for the price I wouldn't get all these extras. After soaking some overnight and putting them in a smoothie or making nut milk with them it all seems worth it though. Plus if ya have a kid it is a great job for them sorting."
2395,"Got this for my parents for the month of december along with a couple other red buffalo coffees. They seem to really like it and my mom says that it has a rich flavor, but at the same time doesnt taste like a synthetic flavor.<br /><br />They love it"
2396,"Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor."
2397,"I used to get these at Target, but they stopped carrying them. So, naturally, I turned to Amazon. Voila. Now I can buy them by the case and never have to worry about running out of them.<br /><br />Diced tomatoes, habaneros, and jalapenos. All in the same can! :-) I use this item everywhere, all of the time. Don't know how I got by without it."
2398,"I've recently brought my dog this low budget meal sadly because I live off scholarship money and student loans and no longer live with my parent.......... I was temporarily buying my dog this food until my money came from school because I usually feed my shizu Purina one and refrigerated dog food. ........This food had my dog sick,hair fallen out in clumps, itching badly and throwing up............... I had to call my mother and have her to go out and buy her the food she usually eats. Yes I portioned the food to get her adjusted to the new food and I've done this for two months. I couldn't go on longer feeding my dog this poison ,........so if you love your dog stay away from this food........"
2399,The grass starts growing with a couple days and is full grown in about a week. I watered it about a 1/4-1/3 of a cup a day. Just enough to wet the dirt. Too much or too little will kill it pretty quickly. My cat likes it. I think she prefers some kinds over others but she eats it all. Mine has been growing over a month and still looks good.
2400,"I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs. This tea has an obvious effect, though it takes about half an hour to kick in. I smells like crap, but if you mix it with mint tea, it isn't as noticeable. I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells."
2401,"The Brit's have out done us. The flavor is supreme,they satisfy my hunger for steak and onions...<br />Get them while you can...  Their other flavors are great tooo"
2402,"Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.  I cut them in half because they are so expensive but I've been able to find them at much better prices on Amazon than in the pet food stores even with the manufacturer's infrequent coupon.  If your dog loves these, buy them online and save."
2403,This is my favorite oatmeal! It has little pieces of real apple in it and lots of cinnamon. Delicious.<br />If you want to make it by boiling your water first (negating the need for a microwave) you can just pour 1/2 C of boiling water over it in a bowl. it cooks up in just a couple of minutes.<br />Try this! You'll love it!
2404,"Oh my sweetness. These wafer cookies blow my mind!!!<br />I'm not a big fan of waffles or wafers, I usually perfer chocolate chip regular cookies as my treat. Until my mom brought home this, which is a complete disaster because we both are completly like obsessed with it now even though we only bought like one bag at time (trying to have self-control here) Eventhoughe  me and my mom havent buy these on amazon yet but I just want to tell you guys how AWESOME those afer cookies are!!<br />I mean I have never taste something this creamy and delicate. The dark chocolate flavored totally rocked my world~ and from seeing all the reviews makes me want to try the lemon ones so baddd."
2405,"My dogs really seem to love this stuff, but we're still transitioning from a combination of Blue Buffalo Weigth Control and Purina Beyond.  Not sure if they ""love"" it just because they're on diets and want more food or if they really enjoy the flavor :)  I switched to this after reading several reviews, including the dogfoodadvisor.com 5 star rating.  We needed a food that had fewer calories per cup so that we could try to give the dogs a little more quantity without increasing the total caloric intake.  I was ready to stick with the Blue Buffalo Weight Control, but decided to go with this instead.  No problems with the Blue Buffalo, they really seemed to like that too, just needed lower caloric density to help us achieve our weigh goals for the dogs.  Each time I up the ratio of Premium Edge to the Blue Buffalo/Purina Beyond mix, their stool gets a little mushy - but this is to be expected as you're adjusting your dogs diet.  I expect it will be a full month before I've fully transitioned them to Premium Edge.  I tried to find this at a local pet store and the best I could do was an offer to special order it for me.  Being able to buy this on amazon and have it delivered straight to the house is really convenient."
2406,Costumer service is great. I had a little problem but it got fixed. I recommended them. Don't wait. buy it.
2407,"I have always loved these chips and buy them often at the grocery store. Since Amazon offered them at a very good price I purchased a case, However, upon receipt I was disappointed and immediately notified the company (Garden of Eatin). They were not as good as the ones in the grocery store (they seemed to be darker and greasier)and I wondered if they were old. The expiration date indicates they are fine. I do not dislike them, though I love the store ones, and have decided to keep them. Salsa can fix anything. However, I will not purchase them again in bulk from Amazon. My biggest disappointment has been that the company never responded to my email."
2408,"Just now poured up some great wine. This type of yeast was used to make a sweet red ( from Welches Grape Juice ) and the alcohol content it produced was up around 12%, which is not too much and not too little. Great product!<br />R"
2409,"Knowing well that my wife and I have taken to this refreshing drink, our son regularly<br />  sends us (through amazon.com) Zico- pure premium coconut water (natural). It is a very<br />  convenient and economic way to order and receive the product at our doorsteps.  My<br />  wife especially likes the drink and enjoys it almost daily.<br /><br />  The taste is not quite the same as that of fresh coconut water, but it comes pretty close.<br />  If one feels really thirsty or dehydrated and looks for something other than plain water,<br />  this product could be very satisfying."
2410,"This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it."
2411,Our son is serving with the Army in Iraq and we order this candy on a regular basis as this is his favorite snack.
2412,Waffle flour is extremely good.  You just have to add water and butter. It makes the best waffles I have ever tasted!
2413,"the ENTIRE spear is edible, which is great.<br /><br />I bring the contents of two entire cans to a boil, then pour it in a blender.<br />Store the resulting puree in the fridge and serve a delicious cup heated in the microwave.<br /><br />You can find much cheaper cans at supermarkets,<br />but its much lower quality.<br />Much of the stem is not edible because it is fibrous !"
2414,"This soup is wonderful! The flavors are so well blended and the black beans are the<br />best addition to this soup! Southwestern in a cup!!  Very convenient to heat and serve.<br />Best of all, Amazon delivers it directly to my door."
2415,"The seller was great!  I had a problem during delivery, which resulted in the drink powder spilling out of the canisters....I wrote the seller, and within a week or two he replaced my order with no extra cost or hassle....mistakes happen, but I could not have been more satisfied with the way the situation was resolved...."
2416,"I just purchased a bag of these at a local health food store. They are fabulous! Extra crispy, lightly salted, perfecto! My husband who is not gluten free loved them too. Said he couldn't tell the difference from regular. I too paid half the price only $3.49. Would be nice if Amazon could bring us a ""by the case"" value price for these."
2417,"I think all of us Keurig owner's are looking for a better, make that cheaper:), alternative to the original k-cup. So far I have tried San Francisco Bay (ech), Broklyn's (not crazy about it) and now this one - Martinson Variety Pack (the best one yet). Tried all the different blends except the Hazelnut (not looking for a flavored coffee), and I would buy any of them on their own. Much better to me than the others:)<br />Really looking forward to trying the Brown Gold variety pack by this same company - if Amazon ever does get any in stock that is!"
2418,"We've been pretty satisfied with these overall. They produce a nice stinky drink that does its job. My husband thinks the water should be more carbonated, but I'm not sure if that's us doing it incorrectly, the grains themselves, or him being too picky.<br /><br />Make sure you have lots of glass bottles. We look like crazy people now with all the bottles we have around the house."
2419,This is the best coating/glaze to help make BBQ Chicken. I never can find it is the stores so I always buy it here and it is so much cheaper then a store. I pour it in a pie pan roll the chicken in it then bake. After I roll all the chicken I put the remaining glaze in a Zip Lock gallon bag and place in the freezer till the next time. Sometimes I mix the glaze with plain Chicken Shake n Bake for a crunchy BBQ coating.
2420,I can't even describe how gross this is.  It tastes like pennies were left in a bucket of water for weeks. This is a hype-based marketing ploy.  Stay away...so nasty !!!
2421,I could eat this everyday (sometimes I do!) It's a hearty soup packed with ingredients so it's more like a meal than a bowl full of liquid. It tastes great and I feel satisfied and wonderful after eating it. I highly recommend this!
2422,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
2423,"I get this every winter to have in the mornings on the way to work.  It's fantastic!  I rarely have caffeine either, but this seems to give me a little kick as well.  But, it tastes so good when it hits your lips..."
2424,"For Me Timothy's coffees are really Great, this Decaf is the same great taste as regular coffee without the caffeine. If you like decaf coffee, try Timothy's"
2425,This is especially good on pork. I dry rub on roasts and ribs!<br /><br />Great flavor and not too much heat.
2426,These are one of my dog's favorite treats. So glad this big box is available. Great value for what you get
2427,"I'm not an Earl Grey fan myself, but I bought this for my Earl Grey fanatic boyfriend. He says it tastes different than Twinnings, but he loves it just the same."
2428,"After purchasing a 6-pack of Torani syrups, I realized pumps would make everything much easier and cleaner. I was ecstatic to find that not only did Torani offer their own brand of pumps, but they were also offered in a multi-pack!<br /><br />The one downside of this is they sell their syrup packs in quantity 6 and the pumps are sold in a pack of 5. No big deal if you don't mind holding out on a flavor to use later on.<br /><br />The pumps feel very durable like they will last many uses. I have almost gone through my pack of syrups, and there is no question the pumps will be used on the next set.<br /><br />This item is highly recommended if you use Torani syrups."
2429,I usually buy this from a pet store (but they either ran out/stopped stocking it) and the price here would have been lower...had it not been for the s&h charge. Product is the same one I always use and that makes me happy. Thank goodness for Amazon! :D
2430,"I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep.

I don't see any problem with the flavor, it does not taste like it smells."
2431,"I've used this product considerably since I've moved to a different climate.  In this climate I break out along my t-zone, which I never had an issue before, but using this product enables me to help minimize and control the breakouts.  I also notice that this product helps fade away old acne scars.. not completely, but it does help minimize the appearance.  I have combo skin, therefore I only dab it on the affected or broken out areas rather than putting it all over my face because I noticed it did dry out my dry areas.  I also use it everyday on the affected areas without any issues.  I can't answer in terms of pores, but I do feel like the next morning after applying this product my skin tone looks more even."
2432,"I have a 2 year old wheaten terrier that's been on Wellness Core for about 6 months.  Very happy with the results, he's a very fit and and active dog.  Wheatens are supposedly not good with wheat oddly enough.  This is one of the highest rated foods by dogfoodanalysis.com and it's pretty easy to find locally now.  I haven't found this through a Prime vendor yet but I keep hoping.<br /><br />***Update -coming up on 4 years soon and this formula is hard to find at local stores. I like giving him the variety of the different flavors..."
2433,"These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again."
2434,I couldn't find organic apple butter in the stores. Fortunately Amazon carried it. We are enjoying it. Good taste! We would recommend this product.
2435,"For decades I have cooked barley the long way - simmering for almost an hour, watching the pot so it doesn't boil over, scouring the sticky, gooey pot afterwards. I recently gave this product a try and am now a convert. No more long vigils at the stove watching a pot simmer.  This is wonderfully flavorful, full of all the healthy stuff we are looking for, and so much easier to cook, in a lot less time. I used to freeze the long-cooking kind and now I cook batches of this and freeze in smaller portions as well.<br /><br />I have even simmered this quick cooking barley along with whole wheat orzo together in the same pot, drained it and frozen it for future use in soups, stews, etc.<br /><br />Never again will I waste an hour of precious time cooking barley the long way. This quick cooking barley will now become a staple in my cupboard."
2436,Was very disappointed in this coffee. The beans were very dry (should have had some oil). There was nothing in the taste to make it better than any other dark coffee on the market. For the price it sells for I would not buy it again.
2437,"Do not order these online.  They are shipped in the flimsy box that the grocery stores use.  No additional packaging is used to protect the inside.  My box was crushed on three corners, adding to the already crushed chips.  I wound up feeding them to the birds."
2438,"I, like most other college students find it very hard to keep a balanced diet so needless to say i don't get a lot of fruits and vegetables. This drink is delicious and has really made me feel a lot healthier after drinking it for some time. There are a lot of different flavors but this one is by far my favorite. The only problem is that its hard (for me at least) to find this flavor. All of the 5 grocery near me are always ether sold out or don't have any in stock. I would not recommend buying it from Amazon however because they are overpricing it by miles. 40 some dollars for 8 bottles? if you can find this juice at Target or places like that you are far better off, its usually around 3 dollars (or less if on price cut) a bottle so if you were to buy 8 bottles it would only be 24 dollars, Amazon is charging twice the amount of what its worth. My advice would be for you to buy this drink, but buy it somewhere else."
2439,good made good boba but too expensive!!! The product is good but if they offered two at the same price it will be better. I went to other sites and they are offering way more than ~9 oz for a little more money. So look around online if you want more for your money. Small tapioca pearls are good for boba too. Hope this helped!
2440,"Cooked according to package instructions, water turned like thin glue and the ""pasta"" noodles fell all to pieces before getting tender.  Worst gluten-free pasta ever!"
2441,"I like the flavorful aspect of this cereal.  The individual flavors blended well, but the burst of vanilla was a surprise.  I think the kids might even like the flavor enough to not even realize this is a healthy choice.  With so many ""empty"" choices out there, this is the great alternative.  A healthy good tasting breakfast cereal is now not an oxymoron."
2442,"This is a pleasant mint, but if you are used to Wintergreen Altoids this product will disappoint you."
2443,"I liked the idea of the mix by the nut company. However, the mix had 70% raisins with some dried cherries, a few walnuts, and miscellanous other nuts. I liked it, but it was not what I thought I was buying. I won't be buying it again."
2444,"Cheddar cheese and jalapeno, the perfect combination on a peanut! Its great with a beer and ballgame. Love the bite!"
2445,"With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given ""medicine"". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money."
2446,I saw these cookies advertised in a magazine and thought they would be great.  None of my local grocery stores had them so I bought them from Amazon.<br />They are definitely NOT worth the almost $7 per bag price.  The bags have 8 cookies in them.  They are tasty but not that tasty.<br />Save your money and buy other Pepperidge Farm or other brand at your local store.
2447,"For the love of all that is decent, do NOT choose the ""Buy It Used"" option. Just trust me on this one.<br /><br />(Written from my hospital bed)"
2448,Must better than the stuff at the grocery store that costs 10 times more.
2449,This is my favorite seasoning for Salmon!  It is the perfect compliment to Salmon and seasons it to perfection.  I have been looking for this in stores before I decided to take my search online.  I forgot how much I really loved it.  We have used quite a few of Chef Paul Prudhomme's seasonings and have never been disappointed.
2450,"I've been eating Trader Joe's Organic Oatmeal with Flax every morning for over a year now. I add one banana and it provides just the right amount of sweetness - no extra sweetener needed. Trader Joe's cereal is popular and sometimes sells out, so I wanted something for those times when I didn't have any more at home. Arrowhead Mills Organic Oatmeal with Flax sounded a lot like Trader Joe's; even the nutritional values were very similar, so I figured I would give it a shot. Well, it's OK, but lacking a certain natural flavor that Trader Joe's has. Even adding a sweet banana didn't help and I had to put in additional sweetener, which I'm trying to avoid. To tell the truth, even adding the sweetener didn't help that much. It didn't satisfy and only left me craving Trader Joe's. Now when I'm at Trader Joe's and my cereal is in stock, I make sure I buy some - even if I don't need it. I don't want to run out. Sorry, Arrowhead Mills; close, but no Trader Joe's!"
2451,"This syrup has an excellent vanilla flavor, that's hard to believe is zero calories. I can now enjoy my much loved vanilla egg creams with only a few calories. Highly recommended, and Amazon's price is much better than at most retail stores."
2452,"I bought this as a gift for a co-worker, and she told me her family enjoyed the cheese a lot.  That said, I was disappointed with this as a gift, as the box was much smaller than I expected and the unattractive, very loose ribbon made a weak presentation.  (I couldn't re-tie the ribbon or even remove it, since it was attached with a sticker to the box and would have ended up tearing the box.) Overall, I won't be buying this as a gift again - better to find a great local cheese shop and wrap everything properly."
2453,Love having a sugar free cider. It makes a comforting brew and is good iced as well. Because of the intense flavor I found that I prefer to brew with at least 10 oz of water.
2454,"I really like this and I'm back for more. It does have a slight artificial sweetner taste to it. I don't mind at all but I know for some that's a deal breaker. I ordered this in autumn when I traditionally start to crave hot cider. Soon, I found I was reaching for it all the time. It's perfect for when I think I've had enough caffeine for the moment. Plus, it's guilt free with only ten calories a cup. This is the first product I've signed up for auto shipping. I've come back twice now and figure this is gonna be a constant in my cubbard."
2455,"I love using organic milk, but this made our baby girl very gassy, fussy and she spit it up.<br />Since switching her to Enfamil Gentlease she has been fine. I wish they'd make a gentler organic milk formula too.<br />At 8 weeks we have gone back and tried this formula again b/c we had 2 big cans of this left in the cupboard. She has no problems now with this formula at all. So we will now use this from now on since organic milk is important to us."
2456,"I first had this mustard in Paris and loved it. It is great to be able to purchase it now in the states. This is a good size crock, well worth the price, I have carried many home from Paris! I can't find any other mustard in the states that has the same quality of taste.<br />Pommery mustard makes a wonderful marinade for chicken with some olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, rosemary, a few red pepper flakes, fry it in olive oil... its amazing. Leftovers (if any) freeze good too.<br /> Also makes a vegetable dip that everyone wants the recipe for - mayo, sour cream, minced onion, minced garlic, pommery mustard: its so good you don't need the veggies!<br />I am not a fan of plain mustard so don't know if you can use this product alone as a condiment.<br />Bon appetit"
2457,"I got it today and tasted it right away. I just mixed up a heaping teaspoon with some hot water left over from making tea. It mixed up very quickly & easily. The taste was a little more bland than the regular jar brand to which I am accustomed. I let my Mom taste it and she agreed it's not bad, and she eats a lot more PB than I do. I think it needs jelly or honey :) If you want to know who LOVED it I will tell you - my dog - she licked that little bowl clean."
2458,"Both my dogs love these treats.  They have both tried the salmon and the chicken flavor.  The only reason we didn't try the peanut-butter flavored ones is because they already get peanut butter in their kongs as a treat, so we used salmon and chicken as a ""variety.""<br /><br />Great for treats in general, and also perfect for training!<br />For training purposes - we actually cut them into fourths (we have a picky yorkie and a puppy who will be a medium sized dog).  At 3.5 calories per treat - cut into FOURTHS - I am happy to give them as many as they need during training sessions without worrying too much about feeding them too many treats and spoiling their mealtime!  Very easy to cut into the right size.  Even after cutting them into fourths, my yorkie and puppy still have to chew a little.  So it's actually a little necessary for us to cut them or else we have to wait too long for them to chew it and swallow before continuing with the training session.  So cutting it makes it a better bite-sized morsel that makes them happy but quick to gobble up.  I'm sure once our puppy gets bigger we will only cut into halves and then not at all later.  But currently he still likes to take a few happy chews of his 1/4-zuke!<br /><br />They are quite odorous (which is probably why the dogs love them so much) - so it maybe takes some time to get used to the first few times you are digging into the treat bag.  But it gets better later  :)  But whatever the dogs like and is safe to eat works for me!"
2459,"I really like Nu GO bars, flavors I like best are banana & orange"
2460,"My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!"
2461,"i originally purchased this product in an attempt to quit smoking by using this mullein and some lavender to help with my cravings to smoke. not only does is taste great as an herbal cigarette, the sender left a little card with instructions for how to make a delicious tea with her product! i was very happy with this service and how quickly the product arrived. Thank you!"
2462,"A natural gum with real peppermint flavoring, not that fake stuff in commercial gums."
2463,"Wolfgang Puck coffees are very good. This particular flavor of decaf is delicious - doesn't taste like decaf at all, very rich & flavorful. Also, this was a very good value for the price. I've recommended this product to several friends."
2464,"I love the large, plump size and variety of raisens in each bag.  They add a nice sweet and chewy taste to my morning high fiber cereal."
2465,"Just wanted to share our opinion that this product makes the best iced tea ever.  The Passion Fruit flavor is subdued, but really brings the overall flavor up. We first came across it at the Lost Dog restaurant on Lake Michigan.  Then found it on Amazon. Try and enjoy it!"
2466,"1st , i buy a box , which is six or seven bags in it , i ate the whole box in days , went and i buy another box , ate 2 bags and the rest i gave to friend"
2467,"I have not used this in few years,but a bought the biggest bag lowes had for around 10 or 12 bucks.I planted some seedlings in a hurry , no sooner got them potted and realized the mistake I made.It is 50% wood chips and pine bark that actually smells like it came from a forest fire.There is nothing it it that even looks like soil.This is just a friendly note to anyone thinking of using this.DONT DO IT,this is crap,junk,the worst.I wont call it garbage,because decomposed food would be way better.I will never buy anything with the Miracle-Gro name on it again."
2468,"This cheese is baked until crunchy and is a low carb, low calorie snack.  It tastes burnt and is extremely crunchy, like tooth breaking crunchy.  I will not buy it again."
2469,I use this product for baking artesian baquettes in a deck pizza oven. My bread rises best with this product. Would use no other.
2470,"Okay, first of all, be sure you note the design.  This liquid treat comes in a liquid-deodorant-type container. The idea seems to be that you just have the dog lick it directly off the roller ball.  This plan happens to be a poor plan.  The roller ball doesn't roll freely.  So, I wind up sticking my fingers on the ball to help it roll--thereby getting nasty liver smells on my hands. I do have the liver flavor only; I *thought* Vine was sending one of each flavor, but we just got liver, so my dog has only ""taste tested"" this one flavor.  She approved heartily of the taste.  Scored big wags.  These are low cal, but unless your dog is on a particularly restricted diet, she/he should be able to spare a few calories a day for treats (there are several 2-10 calorie per treat options out there, like Zukes and Mother Hubbard Minis.  Good old fashioned green beans make good, all natural, dog treats, too).  If it dispensed more easily, I would have given this  four stars instead of only two.  But the combination of it's oddity and having to finagle the roller ball with each use lost it at least one star.  Personally, I rate it two stars; my dog however gave it five (she basically likes food in general, though, and she's never met a treat she didn't like)."
2471,"I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill. I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!"
2472,"i don't know what's going on in the grocery stores but I use a lot of Good Seasons Italian and Caesar Salad Dressing Mixes. I combine the two packages with just enough white vinegar (about 1/4 cup) to make a thinnish paste and marinate either beef or chicken with it. Then I bake, bbq or broil the meat.<br />I can't find any store anymore that carries it. I found it on Amazon.com and placed an order that came FAST. Hopefully they wont' run out. I intend to get more from this person.<br />Thank you SO much.<br />Try the recipe, it's delicious.<br />Gail Thompson"
2473,"These are very delicious little Desserts with a gooey melon center and a great alternative to average high fat cakes. The texture at first may seem a bit odd to many, but the taste is wonderful. It's a very clean, natural taste and I highly recommend them. But you only get eight cakes, and you will be wishing for more when you have finished with them. So I suggest you buy at least two or three packs at a time."
2474,Drain cleaner? HA! HA! That's funny. I'm sure some people would love to suck the vinegary goodness right out of that balsamic soaked clog.
2475,"these pretzels are great! these taste better than non gluten free pretzels. crunchy, tasty just the right amount of salt.  great snack option for restricted diets."
2476,"I've tried every coconut water there is. In a can, in a carton, in glass, in a coconut... Taste Nirvana is hands down the very best there is. Still to this day I try the new products that come out for comparison, but I always waste my money & palate. I love the 16.2oz size, I just wish I could get the coconut water with aloe in this size (love the added fiber!) on Amazon. If you've ever wanted to try coconut water, but you're fearful of the taste, DRINK TASTE NIRVANA. You'll love it. I buy 5 cases a month & drink two cans a day to stay hydrated & healthy & happy!"
2477,"My dogs went crazy over these. They have a very strong fish smell, but if you like to make your dog happy, it's a great treat."
2478,"I bought this for some people who helped me move. The shipping was easy to track and it arrived well before the estimated shipping time frame. The packaging was nice and the recipients loved it. I was cautious about ordering this after reading some of the reviews here. However, I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend this as a ""Thank You"" gift."
2479,"As another reviewer has noted, the product description was a bit misleading. I thought I was getting four 7oz jars of Alaskan Salmon Roe. What I received was six small 5oz tins of something purporting to be salmon roe. Most of the writing on the label is in Russian, but it does say ""Product of USA."" This is all a bit off-putting, as we were planning to give the jars as gifts. Now I guess I'll have to open one one to check things out. The can has a stamp indicating that it was packed only 2 week ago.<br />If the product inside is any good, I'll upgrade this by a star (to 4), if so-so I'll leave it at 3 or maybe 2. If bad, the minimum one star."
2480,"This is a great tasting coffee. Not only good first thing in the morning, but anytime. Very smooth. Green Mountain puts out great tasting coffee on all flavors and blends"
2481,"I have been a fan of Gevalia's Swiss Hazelnut for about two years...however the new formula in the new packaging/logo from Tassimo is HORRENDOUS! The original formula had subtle hazelnut flavor that tasted like it was in the roast itself....the new tastes like they added a cheap shot of hazelnut syrup and a couple of vanilla shots to boot! This is nothing like the original, which had a medium roast taste, the new brew is watery, sickly sweet and off putting. Please beware this is not the same brew as the old packaging. Unfortunately, I cannot return this item and am now stuck with this terrible coffee."
2482,"As with there other oat grahams, these are delicious.  No health food, cardboard taste here.  Most of my kids, and I have 8, loved them.  They have more of a granola bar taste than traditional graham cracker.  It's nice to have a snack that tastes good and is good for you too.  Very yummy."
2483,"With coupon which you can get from Eight O'Clock website, you can get this same size bag for $10.49, where is the discount???"
2484,"This product is pretty nasty. AND you have to get three jars at once. We ended up putting one in the fridge to be ignored indefinitely and the other two will go as gag gifts. It tastes a little like the fake bacon bits that you can sprinkle on salads, but nothing like real bacon. The consistency is like the mucus that you hack up when you have a bad chest cold. Perhaps the regular is better, but I wouldn't recommend this product. I ordered the Lite on accident. However, I have been so displeased with the Lite product that I will not bother with another three bottles of the original."
2485,"Snackwell caramel popcorn adds a new twist to caramel corn.  The chocolate drizzled on them adds a new dimension to the flavor.  They have a sweet, salty and chocolaty taste that is well balanced.  Like all Snackwell snacks, they are not too high in calories (130) or fat (3 grams).  The size is just right for a quick snack but you only get 6 packs per box so you'll want to get several.  Seriously, these don't taste like a ""light"" snack.  They are really good!"
2486,"Neccos disappeared so gradually from retail stores that it was a while before I realized they were truly gone, and I'd have to buy them over the Internet.  What a shame--I still have an occasional craving for them and just have to have them!<br /><br />My favorites were the old lavender (clove) ones.  Where else can you get clove flavored candy? When I received my order, I thought they had discontinued that flavor, since I saw only white, pink, pale grey, yellow, brown, and orange.  It turns out that the new, reformulated lavenders are so pale in color that they are almost indistiguishable from white, even in bright light.  They taste much the same, though--yum!<br /><br />Chocolate, the most popular flavor, is noticably different now.  It has a stronger chocolate taste, and I think it's an improvement, but if you loved the original, you may be disappointed that the taste has changed.<br /><br />Green (lime) has been discontinued--a shame, since it was my second favorite.<br /><br />Yellow (lemon) and orange (orange) both have a stronger, more realistic citrus flavors, and again, are different, but perhaps better.<br /><br />Pink and white, both mint flavors, tasted the same as ever to me.<br /><br />Black (liquorice) is now a very pale grey, and still tastes about the same.<br /><br />Overall, the colors have gotten much paler (except for brown), some of the flavors have gotten stronger, but I'm just grateful to get my clove fix.  I hope the new Neccos stick around!"
2487,"Every single serve cup that I have opened has been runny.  Nothing like jelly should be. I tried putting them in the refridgerator to see if that would help, but they are still runny.  I will not purchase this item again as it is a waste of money."
2488,"I selected the Plato treats due to the natural ingredients. Wow, my pug Ponch LOVES them! I currently have a bag each of the duck, salmon and chicken. When we get home from our walk he runs straight to the kitchen and runs in circles waiting by the fridge for his treats! These are the only treats I'll buy."
2489,Creamy Peanut Butter is excellent taste it's a great filling bar as a replacement meal highly reccommended.<br />Other flavors are available and are very good.
2490,I was supposed to get 2 boxes of Jelly Beans in this package - but only one came.  So I paid $12 for a single little box of Jelly Beans?  Can't get in touch with the shipper to get another...not feeling good about this purchase.
2491,"Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula."
2492,"The product seemed stale compared to product previously purchased at the store. Unfortunately, our local stores are discontinuing the sale of this product."
2493,"I posted my review for the quality of this cat food here: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MWBFXY"">Hill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Cat Food - 15.5-Pound Bag</a>, which is the same food as this but in a larger bag.  Here, I just wanted to point out that this smaller size bag is actually much more expensive.  As of the date I'm writing this, this 3.5-pound bag costs $3.71 per pound, whereas the 7-pound bag costs $3.50 per pound and the 15.5-pound bag costs $2.32 per pound.  So you pay over 50% more per pound for this size compared with the largest size.  Just wanted to point this out in case it could save anyone money!  I like the cat food a lot."
2494,"Growing up in San Francisco, home of Mrs. Fields's cookies, I have a very healthy appreciation of soft cookies.  Couple this with the fact that many packaged cookies that you find at the super-market is pretty stiff and crumbly, I'm generally apprehensive when I hear about the words ""gooey"" and ""soft"" when describing such cookies.  Regular Chips Ahoy is no exception, unfortunately.  I do, however, appreciate their chunky chocolate cookies (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VMW1QA"">Chips Ahoy! Chunky Chocolate Chunk cookies, 13-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>), especially the peanut butter ones (don't see them on amazon, though).  Therefore, when I saw the new Chewy Gooey line of cookies, I had hope that this new generation of cookies would continue their improving trend!<br /><br />Sure enough, the cookies were soft.  I wouldn't say that the chocolate was able to stretch like on the main package, but there's definitely more chocolate in these new cookies than in your standard Chips Ahoy.  It's almost like a filling lay, and definitely not just chips being melted more during the baking process.  Honestly, they're strictly not even chocolate chips anymore, more like a fudge.<br /><br />And the big question, are they tasty?  Definitely.  Are they messier?  Yeah, so be even more careful giving them to little kids (or even my 10 year old, who happens to still eat with her hands when we aren't looking).<br /><br />Recommended.  If only they'd bump up the package size closer to the 12-14 ounce of the earlier packages (or even better, make them 16 ounces again!!!!!)  Then I'd give them 5 stars!"
2495,"Quaker rice cakes far surpass these rice cakes in taste.<br /><br />The ones I ordered on Amazon were not good.  They were heavy, crumbly and tasted weird."
2496,"I love green tea, so I am always on the lookout for different varieties.  I really like this tea.  If you let it steep for a while you get a nice taste of the ginger.  This is a great tea to start your morning with or for an afternoon drink."
2497,"Yes the packaging was different than they show on the advertisement but, the flavor was outstanding. I've had several types of pista over the years and this one is fresh and good tasting. Very hard to get Indian Sweets here in the St.Louis area, and this company will get my repeat business! Lightning fast shipping and quality products. I was very pleasantly pleased. The taste was a bit ""mild"" (IE: Not strongly nut flavored) but yet very good as well, not at all to ""mushy"" or hard.<br />Warmly,<br />Jackie"
2498,"I also found these while living in France for 6 weeks.  My favorite potato chips of all time!!  I even contacted the company to see if they would distribute in teh U.S.  They said it was all based on surveys and tests, etc.  I think they are missing a great market for these here.  LLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEEEE them!"
2499,"My husband has been dragged into my Vegan world because of our health and he was a great meat and potatoes kind of guy.  However, he loves pasta and noodles of all kind so I have been able to entice him with some of the great products Amazon sells.  He also likes it because it's quick and easy to cook and he's the cook!<br /><br />I found them a tad salty, but if you add some sauteed vegetables it helps cut down the saltiness."
2500,"Primarily use McCormick spices.  I use this with a couple other McCormick spices to make a salt-free ""house seasoning"" that we use on many proteins, vegetables,and sauces.  Nice to be able to buy in volume.  Great service."
2501,"The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again."
2502,"The antioxidant properties are great, and the melatonin helps me sleep.  It is not a diet drink but since I take this before bed I no longer crave desert because it is like drinking cherry pie.  I mix 2.5 table spoons with some sparkling water and it is a refreshing desert drink."
2503,"I love dark chocolate , when I first started I wasn't picky, I always grab the Hershey special darks when they are on sale and stock up, have  tried a few expensive ones and found many to be to bitter for me. But I really like the newsman's own, I love it's organic, I try to eat organic when possible. This chocolate is not as sweet as the Hershey brand and I like it more, it tastes thick and delicious without to much sugar and yet not bitter, a winner in taste now if they could just work on the price."
2504,"This was a good cup of pepperment tea, not great, but good and fast.  I enjoy the flavor and the speed of delivery.  If you want a terrific cup of pepperment tea you will have to use the old fashion method with tea pot."
2505,"Perfect year round with just about any meat dish, these Omaha Steaks Twice Baked Potatoes are a gourmet delight. The consistency of the whipped potatoes is smooth and the little bits of bacon, peppers and cheese add to the explosion of flavor.  They cook easily in either the conventional oven, or on the grill when wrapped in foil!  Go ahead, treat yourself!"
2506,This was a great drink which I had on a subscription service from Amazon. Amazon discontinued the subscription service on this product which I suspect was because of the vendor. Kraft Foods always did charge an insane price for their Crystal Light products whether you bought the product from a store or Amazon.
2507,"Considering the ingredients in this product, with the exception of sugar, it is a healthy combination.  I am a granola fan therefore was looking forward to trying something new.  The first spoonful was a surprise because I didn't expect it to be so hard and crunchy with an occasional chewy berry thrown in. I didn't like the texture and found it very difficult to eat.  As well, I found it too sweet.  After two spoonfuls I couldn't eat anymore so I gave it to my husband to try.<br /><br />He liked the crunch of the granola but said it was too sweet for him.  He did finish off the bowl but indicated it is doubtful he will eat any more of it.  My thoughts are to soak the rest of the package and add it to muffins. The added fiber will be a bonus.<br /><br />If you don't mind a sweet cereal and like the hard crunch then you may like this product.  I didn't but that's because of my personal preference.  Looking at other reviews many people do like it so you may want to take their considerations in as well."
2508,"The bold, spicy flavor of this chip is great alone or with salsa. The sturdy chip doesn't fall apart in salsa or cheese dip. A great snack that is good for you, too."
2509,this is not southern sweet tea by any stretch of the imagination.  it's very bitter with barely any sweetness to it at all.
2510,"While my cats have alot of toys, the most notable would be the grey and brown versions of this mouse.  With good reason, as all three of my cats are apt to pick them out to play with and carry them through the house.  There are possible as many as 50 between all four corners of my house."
2511,"This is a wonderful healthy snack.  Carry in your purse for a quick filler when you are shopping and have to skip a meal,  or for a quick pick me up when your blood sugar drops.  Great for the grandkids also! Tastes great!!!"
2512,I have been ordering these for years and really enjoyed them.  However the last batch of Orange Smoothie tasted very different from the past.  Almost like sawdust.  Hope its just a temporary thing.  The other flavors were good.
2513,"I keep all of the bags in the fridge and have had no problems with this yeast at all.  It takes a very negligable space in the fridge.  I store the open bag in an old yeast jar from the grocery store.  I use this yeast the same as the really expensive bread machine yeast for making white, wheat, and other breads in my bread machine.  I was a little worried it might not work since one of my cookbooks suggested using more yeast if its not made for bread, but I have not found this necessary.  I will buy this again.  I make almost everything from scratch and have had only good results with this yeast."
2514,"Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't.  They're picky.<br /><br />With Greenies, they all go bonkers.  We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running.  It's become a reliable way to track them all down.<br /><br />One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them.  The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible.  Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.<br /><br />Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.<br /><br />They like them better than catnip."
2515,"Flavigny was the town, I think, where they filmed ""Chocolat."" It has a very ancient candy factory that makes all kinds of pastilles and hard candy. The Violet Pastilles are a round, pan-coated candy. They are white, deeply scented with violet extract and have an anise seed at the center. They are great for sweet breath and the taste, once acquired, is addictive."
2516,"I don't know what I expected.  Coffee pod systems all seem to be geared to someone who prefers weaker coffee than me.  I can reduce the water, but then I get a smaller cup of coffee and it starts being less cost effective.  Plus, the Senseo coffees (both medium and dark roast) are bitter.  These aren't horrible, just mediocre, and they do have caffeine in them and are quick and convenient, so 3 stars."
2517,"Stash tea is one of the best available.  Their Green Tea is not one of their finest products, but for the price on Amazon, you can't go wrong.  I saved about 6 dollars buying it here."
2518,"In the description it states pack of 2, which led me to believe I was receiving 2 40 ounce canisters.  I received 1 canister from OSG.  I can purchase the same amount at Sams Club for half the price.  I spoke with OSG, and got no where.  Buyer beware ."
2519,"Black Jewell brand is my favorite popcorn.  It does pop smaller than major brand popcorn, but it tastes so much better.  Not sure why some reviewers complain about the size of the popped corn. This is my first experience with the crimson, as I usually buy the black kernel, but it tastes just as good.  I recently couldn't find Black Jewell in my local supermarket and I had to buy regualar popcorn.  I hated it. So glad I found it on Amazon! You'll realize what crud you've been eating all your life if you eat this for a while and then have to eat supermarket popcorn again."
2520,"This is definitely a tea that stands alone.  This tea is from a bitter, cooling-type herb. Good for problems with digestion, this tea does whatever is necessary to get your GI system back in order. Do not steep too long and remove the tea bag.  Sip slowly and enjoy the roasted flavor of this calming and detoxifying drink."
2521,My spouse and I love hot and sour soup but this has got to be the worst I've ever had.
2522,I am very pleased with my shipment of wiskas tender bits turkey with giblets. I have been unable to purchase the box of all one flavor. I have tried to special order this at my local store and been unsuccessful on several occations. purchasing this through amazon.com I am able to get my cats favorite food on a regular bases.  thank you amazon.com
2523,"As always, anything with Velveeta is _really_ good and after trying this dinner kit I really want to try some of the other kits they displayed on the box like the Nacho one and the BBQ chicken.  Yum!"
2524,"i bought this hoping this would taste like commercial nacho cheese.  To me it tastes like and has the consistency of  soup - though nacho flavored.  for a nacho cheese soup, i'd give this 4 stars.  i wanted to use this as a chip dip, and i'd have to recommend something else."
2525,"I live with 3 dogs: 75 lb shepherd/collie mix, 37 lb. spaniel/? mix, and a 17 lb. chihuahua/dachshund mix.  Only the Chiweenie can get the food out of this toy---which is a good thing really because he is the only one with a weight problem.  He is also the youngest and the one most likely to get into trouble when left at home alone.  He drags this toy around by the hard rubber ball part, then lays it flat on the floor, pushing and pulling the rubber rope until he empties it.  The other dogs just watch, but never attempt it themselves.  It is easy to refill except I struggle sometimes with lining up the grooves on the screw-on lid.  It washes well in the dishwasher.  I recommend this toy for every dog, but many dogs will need a little occupational therapy to learn how to use it."
2526,I discovered quinoa recently. You can read all about the health benefits. It's a great substitute for rice or couscous and has more substance. This is a great value for prewashed quinoa...much cheaper than the local grocery.
2527,"I love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNMZA4"">Crystal Light Lemonade Drink Mix (8-Quart), 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> so I thought this new product would be perfect for me as this is my favorite cocktail! So wrong. The color is right, but that's about it. The taste is flat and just boring. Perhaps made with seltzer it might have some zing, but as is this is a waste of time and money. Took 2 qts over to my parents for a 2nd opinion and they said the same. On the rocks is no better. Perhaps as a diet mixer version it might work."
2528,"Gourmet food for growing taste buds. In today's age we can't seem to get any kid to eat veggies, let alone enjoy them. These little packets are not only tasty but give little taste buds an excellent introduction into good eating habits."
2529,I loved this flavor and the 4 packs lasted me for a while. The jerky was a good quality one would expect from Jack Link's so no surprises there. A great product.
2530,"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though."
2531,I really like the bold taste of this coffee and it isn't bitter nor does it leave an aftertaste.  I keep buying this coffee cause I think it's the best for the money.
2532,"I have been giving my dog this for several weeks as a treat and am not sure if she is really getting any juice or she just loves the smell. It is hard to tell if the ball is turning when she licks it or if it remains stationary. She always comes running when she sees me pull it out the pantry so I assume that she is still getting her 'treat'. I do like the size of the container, but wish that I could tell how much is remaining."
2533,"These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one. We even got a few people hooked as you dont see these in your every day supermarket in Denmark. Just great taste, fresh and delicious.<br />Yours Natasha (DENMARK)"
2534,A friend of mine recently had miscarriage and I wanted to send her something to brighten her day.  I didn't want to send flowers or an overpriced gift basket with barely anything it so I decided to look for something yummy on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime and it would be free two day shipping and low and behold I stumbled across FunkyChunky!  Two days later I got very happy phone call from my friend raving about how yummy this was and that she couldn't stop eating it.  Success!
2535,"I am a very sensitive Celiac, and this product is a staple of my diet. It is so easy, soothing on the system, and versatile. My favorite thing to make with it is a quick ""risotto"" with butter and Parmesan cheese. Better than any GF mac-n-cheese option out there!"
2536,"Liked Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats, roasted chicken. My dogs liked this and considered it as a treat. They seem to run about a bit better too."
2537,A meat stick that tastes like Ham & an American cheese food-type stick.<br />I prefer the Ham flavor over the oh-so-salty beef stick.<br />Great to fight hunger pains while biking or backpacking or waiting for your fish to bite your hook.
2538,"I got all exited seeing more reviews that it works.  My daughter is 3 half month and suddenly I start having less milk.  So I ordered fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules.  I was taking 3 fenugreek and 2 blessed thistle with meals for a week and I didn't see really any change. One lady suggested me something else that helped her.  Walnuts!!!  I know from back in the days mom said that that's what doctors used to tell nursing moms.  To eat walnuts for more and fatty milk.  So I got a biggest bag they had in Walmart and ate it, I at probably good 6 oz of nuts at the end of the day I had more milk then my daughter needed and that night.  I am on my second day and so far I had enough milk and some extra.  I eat about 2 hand fools of walnuts a day.  My husband said it takes time for herbs to get into my system and seeing that its helping more moms, I will finish up the bottles and see if it will give me more milk.  I will get back on how it worked.  So moms try walnuts no other nuts but walnuts and see if that would help you, if fenugreek and blessed thistle didn't work for you. Gods Blessing!"
2539,This coffee is outstanding.  I have had several different varieties of Kicking Horse Coffee and it never fails to please.  Love this coffee.
2540,"I'll be fully frank: I'm not a health food fan. I tend to avoid things that say ""organic"" on them like the plague. Not that I eat only junk, but in my experience a lot of things that are labeled as health food simply don't taste edible.<br /><br />I was very skeptical that this granola would be healthy and delicious, but I was wrong! How good is Love Crunch? I had to pry it away from my kids AND my husband just to get a taste!!<br /><br />What sets Love Crunch apart is two things: the fruit bits and the chocolate bits. The chocolate is delicious! Dark chocolate pieces that taste as chocolate should. Very yummy! The fruit pieces shocked me because many of them are tiny, but they pack a huge punch when you put one in your mouth.<br /><br />The only downside to this bag is that both my husband and I wished for more chocolate and more fruit pieces. The granola was delicious, however, and almost tasted like it was a crunchy no-bake chocolate cookie that had been smashed up.<br /><br />We were definitely surprised by this granola and are going to be ordering more!"
2541,"After our dog turned one and was off of puppy food we started noticing that whenever he ate he would throw up.  We tried all kinds of dog foods but nothing would help.  We finally took our dog to the vet and he was diagnosed with pancreatitis.  Our vet put he on Hill Prescription Diet dog food and it was around $50 a bag for this dog food.  After paying for this expensive food for several months I decided to give Fit & Trim a try & my dog can eat it and not vomit it back up.  He hasn't lost any weight, but maintained his current weight and he can eat without vomiting so that is what is important to us.  Our vet even said that this was a good option for our dog."
2542,Gum tastes great and the flavor lasts a good amount of time.  Not a huge fan of the packaging.  I prefer gum that has individually wrapped pieces of gum so you can hand them to a friend without putting your fingers all over the piece of gum or put a piece or two in your pocket for later.
2543,"The pack is not all jumbo raisins, but has quite a proportion of small raisins too. The ""mixed"" in the title is misleading. I thought it was all jumbo raisins, simply of mixed colors."
2544,Yogi's Cocoa Spice is a VERY good tea.  I was really hooked on Thai Sweet until I tried this one.  Now I alternate between the two. The Cocoa Spice has a great but subtle cocoa flavor and not too heavy on the spice. I like a tea that is smooth and not too spicy.  This one does have a little caffeine.
2545,I love that these cookies are basically scratch in a box. No preservatives or artificial anything. I also used coconut oil instead of butter to make them and they were still delicious!!! The only way they could be better was if they were also organic. But I will still buy them as is!
2546,"My Maltese absolutely LOVES anything that Exclusively Pets makes. But if you really want to train your pet, give him or her a cheese treat! The greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says. The cheese treats smell like Cheez It! The carob cookie treats smell like chocolate chip cookies... So forth and so on. I used to buy these locally but saved buying them online."
2547,"It did not taste bad, but disappointing. Not what I had expected. More like sweet, chocolate flavored water"
2548,"Perhaps its my fault for not knowing just how large a 12.2 fl ounce bottle is, but the photo clearly depicts a full size bottle and this most certainly is NOT a full size bottle. In fact, the bottle I received was only half as tall as in the picture."
2549,"I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!"
2550,"From Schultz, I've tried the cacti plant food which is extraordinary! This one is very good as well, you won't regret buying it. I wish they had one for palms..."
2551,I adopted my cat from a shelter and this is the type of food they fed him and urged me to continue feeding him. He absolutely loves it and I won't be changing brands or food anytime soon. It seems to be a very high quality dry cat food and it's definitely one that my cat loves. The big bag of food is great especially if you have large Rubbermaid (etc) containers to store it in so it doesn't get stale. I'm very happy with this food and I'm very glad the shelter (and my vet) ended up recommending it. My cat is happy and I'm happy knowing he is being fed appropriately with high quality food that is helping him stay healthy.
2552,"Senseo is the best home made coffee ever, thank god I found this machine and these coffee pods absolutely the best cup of coffee you will ever have I have been using the senseo machine and pods for the last three years and wouldn't be without the machine or this particular coffee try it you will be amazed at the great taste"
2553,"Wow! This jerky is delicious! I have purchased at least 5 packs. Everyone in my family loves this jerky so much that we can't seem to keep it in our pantry. I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for something different and delicious or if you are a fan of jerky. Plus, for women (and men) jerky fans, this is only one point per piece on weight watchers. :D"
2554,"Let me start off by saying that I am not a tea drinker at all! I am more of a coffee person. Anyway, I decided that I was gonna dry up my milk supply and read somewhere that sage tea decreases milk supply. I went ahead and ordered this tea for that purpose. It says on the box that the tea is very bitter so I went ahead and added 1 teaspoon of honey. It worked perfectly. I do see that it has diminish my need to pump dramatically. I went from pumping 4-5 times a day to twice a day the 1st two days since I started drinking the tea. Yesterday I only did it once and today none so far. I am not in pain, though my breasts are still tender to the touch. I would 100% recommend this to any mother trying to stop her milk supply."
2555,"Our cat loves all the Party Mix flavors, but I ordered this bulk package since it was the best price at the time, plus it helped me get to the purchase threshold for the free super saver shipping!  We generally use these treats a few at a time to get her to bed at night (she sleeps in an extra bathroom with her litter box) or out from under couches, beds, etc.  I've used many of the Friskies products over the years and have liked them all."
2556,"This is pretty strong stuff - if you are not nuts about garlic I would stay away...far away. My entire desk smells like garlic now, ha. The flavor reminds me of garlic bread at an Italian restaurant. There is a little salt on them too, which is great. The pistachios themselves are super fresh and crunchy. If you like garlic AND pistachios this is for you. The onion is very subtle, more of an after taste.<br /><br />One recommendation for Fiddyment Farms would be to dial back the garlic a bit...just a bit, to attract non-garlic fiends. Otherwise, this is a supreme product."
2557,"This is quite a bar - natural (only 3 ingrediants!  No corn syrup!) it tastes great, fills you up, and is a perfect lunch or breakfast.<br /><br />Don't hesitate - these are a great support to a healthy lifestyle."
2558,"Eden Organic black canned beans are excellent.<br /><br />What sets this company apart from the rest is that now their cans are bisphenol-A free.<br /><br />So for those of you that were refusing to deal with Eden Organics because of the bisphenol-A issue, you can now feel good about purchasing their products.<br /><br />Great job Eden Organics!"
2559,"The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.<br /><br />PK"
